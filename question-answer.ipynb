In this way, a completely new facies property can be made and used to condition\\nthe petrophysical modeling.\\nIn the image above is shown an example of a property grid of facies model with channels.\\nTools for interactive facies modeling\\nWhen the Facies modeling is active, a set of icons becomes available in the Function bar. These\\nare divided into property tools and property actions. Note that there is no undo option for these\\ntools and that it is wise to make a copy of the property before starting.\\nThe Facies modeling process dialog has a tab (Edit hints tab) with some hints concerning\\nsome of these tools.\\nFacies modeling Tools bar\\nView Mode - Cursor mode to move the view in the Display window.\\nMagnify (shortcut key Z) - Works in a 2D window and when orthogonal view is turned on in\\nthe 3D window. Click on the icon, then click and drag in the Display window.\\nMeasure Distance (shortcut key D) - Will measure the 2D and 3D distance between two\\ndifferent points in the Display window. Click on the icon, and then click on a point (object) in the\\nDisplay window. When dragging the cursor from that point, the distance is measured and\\ndisplayed interactively. The distance and the direction will be given in project units.\\nManipulate Plane - Only used with a General Intersection. When active, the intersection can\\nbe moved around using the cursor. PgUp and PgDn will move the General Intersection along the\\nnormal; the cursor and the right and left arrow keys will rotate it around the Z-axis. Holding down\\nthe Ctrl key and moving the cursor can also rotate the General Intersection.\\nPick/Select Mode - Cursor mode to pick/select items in the Display window.\\nPencil - Select facies first, then activate the pencil and click on the cells you want to change to\\nthe selected facies. This will only affect single cells.\\nBrush - Works together with all the property actions. Define the property actions before using\\nthe brush. When \"painting\" the model with the brush, the effect will depend on the property\\naction settings.\\nAirbrush - Select facies first and then use the airbrush to \"spray\" the model with the selected\\nfacies. This will only affect the top layer.\\nFill - Select facies first, then activate this tool and click on the model to edit the facies in a\\nspecific layer.\\nSelect facies code - Click on this tool, then click on a facies in the Display window. This is\\nnow the active facies, i.e. the one that will be painted in when using the brush for example.\\nInteractive facies modeling actions\\nRefresh - updates the filter after it has been redefined.\\nChange Visible Only - if the filter and this tool are active, changes made with any other tools\\nwill only affect visible cells - not those hidden by the filter.\\nChange Inside Zone Only - limits the modifications to the zone in which the action was\\nstarted i.e. the zone clicked on with the brush or other painting tool.\\nSelect Facies - click on this tool to get a sub-menu from which you can activate a facies.\\nSelect Brush Radius - click on this tool to get a sub-menu from which you can define how\\nwide the influence of the brushes should be. The radius varies between 1 and 8 grid cells.\\nSelect Height - click on this tool to get a sub-menu from which you can define the\\ndepth/height of the influence of the brush, this varies between 1 and 8 cells, within a zone or the\\nentire model.\\nSelect Profile - click on this tool to get a sub-menu from which you can define the influence\\nprofile of the brush in the vertical direction (rectangle, pipe, lower/upper half pipe).\\nSelect Brush Type - define whether the brush should paint in squares or circles.\\nSelect Origin - define whether the facies thickness should be extended downwards, upwards\\nor both ways from the starting point.\\nInteractive Facies modeling process\\nWhen working with interactive facies modeling, it is possible to start with a model in which all the\\ngrid cells are set to zero and then build up the distribution of facies. It is also possible to start with\\na model that already has some type of facies distribution (e.g. from stochastic simulation) and\\nadjust it according to preference.\\nHow to create a new facies property\\n1.

All geometrical inputs controlling the body shape\\n(width/thickness, etc.) can either be defined deterministically, follow a defined statistical\\ndistribution or be assigned using a trend map.\\nThe background can be assigned a given facies code or an existing facies model. Different\\nerosion/replacement rules can be applied to different bodies. Vertical and areal trends can be\\nused as options for defining the spatial distribution.\\nA trial-and-error approach is probably the best way to begin Object modeling. Start with a\\nsingle object and deterministic parameter settings to get a feel for sizes and shape. Then\\ngradually build in more variation and complexity.\\nHow object modeling works\\nFor each body in the list of objects, the body will first be matched according to the wells, then if\\nthe global fraction is less than requested, additional objects will be inserted until the global\\nfraction is reached.\\nMatch the wells\\n1. Find which of the upscaled cells have the same facies code as the body.\\n2. Make a body with the given facies and geometry for the body, actual geometry parameters\\nare chosen statistically according to the settings.\\n3. Choose a random insertion point on the body.\\n4. Calculate the body thickness at the insertion point.\\n5. Search for that thickness among the upscaled wells still left to be honored (thicknesses\\ngreater than the body thickness are OK as several objects can be stacked on top of one\\nanother. If this is done you will see the 'Splitting' comment in the message log).\\n6. Ensure that the body about to be inserted does not conflict with other upscaled cells.\\n7. If the body passes these checks, insert the body.\\n8. Repeat 2-7 until all the chosen facies codes have been accounted for.\\nBodies are inserted until the global fraction is satisfied. They can be inserted into wells as long as\\nthey are not conflicting with the well data. Make a body with the given facies and geometry for\\nthe body, actual geometry parameters are chosen statistically according to the settings.

Get a random\\nnumber between 0 and 1 and if this number is greater than the probability, reject the body.\\n4. Check if there are conflicts with upscaled cells and the facies replacement rules.\\n5. If the body passes these checks, insert the body.\\n6. Loop until the fraction of the body is higher than the target global fraction.\\nIf the loop is repeated several times without managing to insert a body, it will stop and the\\nrequested global fraction will not be reached.\\nThe order of the bodies in the dialog is important. Although the first bodies may have been\\nmatched with the correct global fraction, bodies lower down in the list may partly replace the\\nearlier bodies, decreasing the global fraction.\\nGeneral notes\\nAll geometrical input (width/thickness...) for the shape of the body is generated according to the\\ninput you have given. For Triangular, Uniform, and Normal distributions, the values will be chosen\\nrandomly. The real width/thickness of the body will be rounded to the nearest number of cells,\\nbased on the average cell size (width, length and thickness) for the specific zone.

In addition, the non-linearity of the model will cause more computational effort\\nper time step. Note that FrontSim's streamline concept will allow the user to use only one long\\ntime step (possibly years), even for this type of model, but the engineering accuracy defined by\\nstandard simulation will be degraded.\\nThe resulting set of partial differential equations cannot be solved by any analytical means due to\\nits typical complexity in geometry, rock property and fluid description. Instead, a so called\\nnumerical approximation is used. Many types of numerical methods are available to solve these\\nequations. Most use some form of a finite difference/volume method that divides the geometry\\ninto many small subsections called cells containing rock and fluid properties. These cells cover the\\nwhole domain and the fluid flow is represented as relationships between these cells. These\\nrelationships result in an equation system with a number of unknowns on the order of number of\\ncells or higher. This equation system will have to be solved for every time step during the\\nsimulation. These methods might require very many small time steps, and because of this, a\\nreservoir simulation process can be a very time consuming affair depending on the geological\\ndetail represented and fluid property modeled.\\nMaking a Fluid Model\\nThe Make fluid model process allows you to generate black oil fluid models from correlations\\nand to create compositional fluid models.\\nFluid models are used by the simulator to define how physical properties of the fluid such as\\ndensity and viscosity vary with pressure and temperature. Fluid models may also define how the\\ninitial conditions in the simulator are to be calculated, by specifying the fluid contacts, pressure,\\nand compositional variation with depth.\\nPetrel supports three types of fluid model: black oil, compositional and thermal live oil. A black oil\\nfluid model specifies values of physical properties of oil and gas in tables. A compositional fluid\\nmodel represents the hydrocarbon fluid by a set of components (typically 6-12 for reservoir\\nsimulation); an equation of state is then used to determine the physical properties of mixtures of\\nthese components as a function of pressure and temperature and the properties of the individual\\ncomponents. A thermal live oil model describes the fluid by a set of components, using K-values\\nto define equilibrium. All types of fluid model can incorporate water, with its properties\\nrepresented as a simple function.\\nThe most reliable way to obtain this information is from a reservoir fluid study using bottom hole\\nor reconstituted fluid samples. Experimental results are processed using a dedicated package such\\nas Schlumberger's PVTi. Fluid models created in this way can be imported into Petrel and used in\\nsimulations.\\nIf laboratory data is not available, both types of fluid model may be created in Petrel from\\nminimal data input. Note that in Petrel while you can create an equation of state, you cannot tune\\nit to match laboratory measurements - for that, you need to use PVTi and import the resulting\\nequation of state into Petrel.\\nData for initial reservoir conditions may also be entered in the Make fluid model process.

Even if this is achieved,\\ncalibration of fracture modeling parameters to flow simulation results demand iterative steps in a\\nworkflow, and then computational performance becomes a limiting factor.\\nPetrel 2010.1 proposes an original numerical representation of the fracture networks so that an\\naccurate calculation of the contribution to the fluid flow of all the fracture sets are present in the\\nreservoir model. You can now create a hybrid model where the bigger and more important\\nfractures are modeled explicitly as discrete patches (Discrete Fracture Network - DFN), and the\\nresidual part of the distribution (smaller fractures) is statistically represented as grid properties\\n(implicit fracture model - IFM).'"
