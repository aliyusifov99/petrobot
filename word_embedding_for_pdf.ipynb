    "The script described below is engineered to meticulously extract and organize text from PDF documents into a more accessible and structured format. It achieves this by discerning section headers and the associated content, ensuring a coherent representation of the information originally laid out in the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an in-depth overview of how the script functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Header Identification Function (`is_header`)**: Central to the organization process is the ability to recognize section headers within the document. The `is_header` function executes this by applying a heuristic that deems a text line as a header if it adheres to certain formatting rules, such as being in uppercase or title case. Given the variability in document formatting, this criterion may require customization to suit the particular style and structure of different PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Extraction and Sectioning (`extract_sections`)**: This function serves as the workhorse of the script, delving into the PDF specified by `pdf_path` and orchestrating the text into an organized ensemble of sections, each marked by a distinct header:\n",
    "   - The function employs `pdfplumber` for its capability to sift through the PDF and draw out the textual content, offering a raw yet comprehensive look at the document's contents.\n",
    "   - It systematically categorizes the text into headers and their subsequent content. The advent of a new header signals the commencement of a fresh section, thereby ensuring the text is partitioned accurately under the relevant headers.\n",
    "   - Upon the culmination of this processing stage, the function compiles the discrete lines of text into unified strings representative of individual sections. The output materializes as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary encapsulating a unique section derived from the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Post-Processing for Cohesive Content Representation**: After the initial segmentation and content aggregation, the script performs an additional step of post-processing. This stage involves merging the list of text lines within each section into a singular, coherent string. This transformation is crucial for preserving the narrative flow and original context of the content, making the extracted information more readable and primed for subsequent analysis or processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resultant Data Structure**: The final product of the script is a cleanly structured list, where each element is a dictionary that contains a distinct section of the original PDF file. These dictionaries consist of two key components: the 'header' detailing the section's title, and the 'content' representing the amalgamated text pertinent to that section. \n",
    "\n",
    "This methodical approach not only ensures the integrity and continuity of the information extracted from the PDFs but also paves the way for more efficient and organized data handling, whether for analytical, archival, or content management purposes."

Select the CRS from the drop-down list (if the CRS has been used in the project before) or\\nselect Other CRS to launch the Coordinate Catalog .\\n4.\\n5. Select the CRS from the catalog. It will now appear in the File CRS drop-down list.\\n5.\\n6. Click OK to import the file and perform the CRS transform.\\nOnce the data has been imported into Petrel, the History of the conversion will be captured and\\nthe data item will be stamped with the original CRS in the Info tab of the item.\\nExample 2 - Importing a well Deviation survey\\n1. Right-click on the well and select Import on selection . Select Well path/deviation and the\\nfile.\\n2. Select input as MD, INCL, AZI and specify the input columns.\\n3. Click on the Coordinates and units tab.\\n4. Specify the deviation CRS from the drop-down or by selecting one from the catalog.\\n5.

Once opened, the windows will appear in the Windows pane on the\\nprocess diagram and can be reopened at any time by checking the tickbox and ensuring that the\\nwindow is bold. Unchecking the tickbox will release the windows from memory, but the data will\\nstill be stored.\\nThe Map, Histogram, Function, Intersection, Stereonet and Well Section windows are also called\\nviewports and can be arranged in a plot window for WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)\\nstyle printing. The well section and interpretation windows are also referred to as plot windows\\nwhile the 2D and 3D windows are called Graphic windows.\\nAt the top of each of the \"real world\" windows is a toggle to switch between the time and\\ndepth domains. Objects in the wrong domain cannot be displayed, and will instead show a grey\\ntick mark in the project explorer. Use if you wish to ensure that all objects are displayed.\\nGeneral window information\\nWhen starting Petrel, a 3D graphics window is opened. More graphical and plotting windows can\\nbe opened from the Window drop-down menu.\\nIt is recommended to minimize the number of open windows, with objects displayed, at any one\\ntime as they might slow the display. This can be done by removing the check box besides the\\nwindow in the Windows pane of the process diagram.\\nAs with all programs using the Windows interface, the active window can be maximized by clicking\\nthe icon in the upper right corner, while clicking the icon will restore your window to the\\nprevious scaling. The window can be minimized by clicking the icon. Open windows can be\\narranged by selecting the appropriate arrangement within the Window drop-down menu (tiled\\nvertically, tiled horizontally, or cascading).\\nCommon tools for all window types\\nAdjust color table on selected - Sets the depth color table, with maximum range, of a\\nselected object in the Petrel Explorer. If a folder with several objects is selected, the range will be\\nfrom maximum to minimum Z-values of all the objects within the folder.\\nNew Window - Opens a pull-down menu from which the user can select which type of new\\nwindow to open.\\nShow/Hide Auto Legend - Displays a color legend of the visible object(s). Click the arrow\\nnext to the legend to open the overall legend Settings window. Define the layout of the legends\\nhere. Depth and thickness color tables can also be defined here.\\nShow/Hide Axis - Toggle a box with axis in X-, Y-, and Z-direction. Click the arrow next to\\nthe legend to edit the axis Settings.\\nFind - Opens a new dialog box. Type in a text string to search for a match in the current Pane\\nor in the entire project.\\nDetails of the 2D and 3D Windows\\nThe 2D window and the 3D window represent the Graphic windows. In these windows, objects\\nimported or created can be visualized in 2D and 3D respectively. The user can switch between\\nView Mode and Select/Pick Mode in the graphic windows by pressing Escape.\\nThe user can also select the domain of the window TWT (Two way time), TVD (True vertical\\ndepth) or Any. If an object is not in the correct domain and has not been depth converted, then it\\nwill not be displayed and will have a grey tick mark. By choosing the Any option, all objects can\\nbe displayed.\\nWhen clicking the right mouse button on the cursor in a graphic window, a pull down menu\\nwill open. Here you can change the way objects are drawn in the Display window. If you have\\nproblems moving large objects in the window (i.e. they jump rather than moving smoothly),\\nselect the move low res option from the Draw style option. Note that the Spin Animation has\\nto be toggled on or off from the System Settings menu. It will then work for all windows. For\\nmore information about the System settings see System Settings.\\nTools for the 2 and 3D windows\\nHome Position - Move to the default view.\\nSet Home Position - Set the current view as the Home position.\\nView All - View the whole data set.\\nMap View Position - Positions the data set so that it is seen from the selected angle. The\\ndefault position is from above with North upwards. Select your preference from the pull-down list\\n(click on the arrow). The Keep focus icon (if selected) keeps the point of focus the same\\nwhen the data set is repositioned. Without this option checked, Petrel will zoom to fit all of the\\nvisible data to the screen.\\nTarget zoom - Click on the icon, and then click on the spot to zoom in on (in the Display\\nwindow). Note that multiple clicks before the selected point will be set as the new center of the\\nview. Zoom also by clicking the shortcut key S. The cursor must be in View mode and the\\nOrthogonal On/Off must be turned off to use this tool.\\nOrthogonal On/Off - Toggles the view of objects in the Display window between perspective\\nand orthogonal projections. Orthogonal projection will display objects with no vanishing points.\\nAnti Roll - Prevents the camera from rolling i.e. keeps the horizon horizontal when the data is\\nbeing moved around in the Display window.\\nCamera linking on/off - It is possible to create a group of 3D windows with shared camera\\nposition. Viewing settings inside the group will be synchronized: each change of camera position\\n(rotation, zooming, view all) in any \"linked\" window will be repeated for all windows in the group.\\nSet Z-scale - Changing this parameter gives a higher/lower relief on the data set. It is\\nunit sensitive, i.e. if XY are in meters and Z is in feet, a distance of 100 units will be approximately\\na third in Z to what it is in X or Y.\\nSet Z domain - Switches between time and depth.\\nShow/Hide Compass - Toggle for a compass arrow indicating viewing orientation of the data\\nset. Click on the arrow to open the Settings window where position and size of the compass may\\nbe defined. The arrow points towards North, and has a green top and a red base (e.g. a red arrow\\nindicates you are looking up from the base. The compass type can be changed to a different icon\\n(from the Settings window).\\nOpen windows settings for color/name - This is used to change the background color of\\nthe Display window. Use the Toggle background color and black to switch color.\\nToggle background color and black - This will toggle between the selected color and black\\nwhich is default.\\nThe Function bar on the right hand side of the Display window contains the important icons during\\nmost process steps:\\nViewing Mode - When this tool is active the cursor will be displayed as a hand in the Display\\nwindow. Press the left mouse button to rotate the view, holding the Ctrl key pans the view,\\nholding both Ctrl+Shift keys will zoom in and out.\\nMagnify (shortcut key Z) - Works in a 2D window and when orthogonal view is on in the 3D\\nwindow. Click on the icon, then click and drag in the Display window.\\nMeasure Distance (shortcut key D) - Will measure the 2D and the 3D distance between\\ntwo different points in the Display window. Click on the icon, and then click on a point (on an\\nobject) in the Display window. When dragging the cursor from that point, the distance is\\nmeasured and displayed interactively. The distance and direction will be given in project units.\\nSelect/Pick Mode - The cursor will become an arrow or a cross when this tool is active\\n(depending on process step active). It allows the user to select/edit objects in the Display\\nwindow. Press the Shift key to select more than one object.\\nArtificial Horizon - When this option is checked, an artificial horizon will be displayed\\nsomewhere in the Display window (depending on where the user sets it to be). The artificial\\nhorizon may help the user to get oriented when working in a 3D view.\\nThe Show/Hide Axis, Compass and Auto Legend options are also available in the Petrel\\nExplorer under the Windows pane. A more detailed description of the Settings windows of the\\ntools available in the Windows pane can be found in Settings for objects in the Windows pane.'},\n",

The settings available are determent by the type of object and are also sometimes\\ndepending on the type of window the user has active. All objects have a statistic tab and a info\\ntab. Most will also have a style tab controlling the way the object (s) are displayed.\\nA standard pattern has been followed for all settings dialogs for the objects in Petrel. This is aimed\\nat making navigation through the program as simple as possible. The following options are\\ncommon to many of the settings dialogs.\\nStyle tab\\nStyle settings under the settings dialog for an object allows the user to control how an object is\\ndisplayed.\\nAs a default, the changes made will usually only affect the object being edited (except when\\nediting templates and color tables),however, this behavior can be overridden. There are a number\\nof options for controlling how changes in the style settings are applied:\\nReset option will apply the default settings.\\nApply the settings to all similar objects in the project. Will copy these settings and paste\\nthem to all other objects which are like gridded surfaces in the entire project.\\nApply the settings to all similar objects in the folder. Will copy and paste the settings\\nonly to similar objects in the same folder.\\nSet the settings as default will set the current settings as the project default for all\\nobjects subsequently added to the project. All objects (with the same template) whose style\\nsettings have not been changed manually will be given the same settings as the current\\nobject.\\nInfo tab\\nThe Info tab exists on every object in Petrel and looks very similar for each of these objects. A\\ntypical Info tab contains the following elements:\\nName - this is the name of the object as it appears in the various panes and can normally\\nbe edited. For a few automatically created objects, the name may be grayed out, indicating\\nit can not be edited. If the name is in italics in the pane, it cannot be edited and will be\\ngrayed out once opening the Info tab. Pressing the reset button will revert the object name\\nto the default name of its template.\\nColor - If the object can be displayed in any window then there will often be a specified\\noption. In this case the specified option will refer to this color. In some cases the color of\\nthe objects icon in the project explorer will also be changed to match this color.\\nType - this entry is non-editable and describes the type of data for the specific object.\\nTemplate* - The template that the data is attached to. The template will determine the\\nway that data is displayed in the various windows, the color of the points, the number\\nformat used for writing out values, the units, etc. In many cases it will also define the\\ndomain of the data and control what is displayed. See Templates and Color tables for more\\ninformation.\\nCategory/object type* - some objects such as surfaces and polygons can have a sub\\ntype to describe the data, e.g. boundary or fault stick. Others, such as wells, have a well\\nsymbol which describes the sub type, e.g. injector or producer.\\nDate* - Certain objects such as simulation results will have an associated date. This is\\nusually editable.\\n(* items with an asterisk are not present for all objects)\\nThere are two sub tabs on the Info tab which provide a means for users to keep track of edits to\\nobjects and decisions made during the project:\\nComments: The user can add any information to the Comment tab, such as the source of the\\ndata that was imported and its reliability. Beneath this section is the name of Petrel's data file for\\nthe object and the name of the file that was imported (if applicable).\\nHistory*: The history of the object is stored within the data structure, including information\\nabout edits and operations performed on the object. By right clicking in this field, the user can\\nadd their own date stamped comments or clear the history completely.\\nFigure 1. The info tab for a surface stored in the Input pane.\\nStatistics tab\\nAvailable statistics for each data object are listed on the Statistics tab. The max and min values\\nfor the XYZ-axis of the object are listed under Axis. Additional statistics are listed under\\nDescription. The description comprises different information depending on object.\\nThe Statistics for the object can be copied with the Copy to output sheet icon at the bottom.\\nCheck the list(s) (List 1 = Axis and List 2 = Description etc.) you want to copy to the Output\\nsheet. By checking the Reset button, the Output sheet will be reset before the statistics are\\ncopied into it. From the output sheet it is possible to copy the statistics to other applications.\\nSettings for objects in the Input pane\\nAll data types or objects have a Settings dialog which can be opened by double-clicking the object\\nin the various explorer panes where they are stored. Some data types also have special menu\\nselections available when clicking on the object with the right mouse button.\\nThe Settings dialog consists of different tabs that can be selected. These tabs can be selected for\\ndisplaying the different Settings options, which depend on the data type you have selected. The\\ntype of Settings also depends on whether you select a single object or a category (folder) of\\nobjects.\\nNote that the Settings window is resizable (click and drag in the lower right corner of the\\nwindow).\\nRight mouse button menus in the Input tab\\nSome right mouse button options are common for several different data types and some are\\nspecific for a data type.\\nGeneral objects (Right Mouse Menus)\\nSettings will open the Settings window for the object.\\nShow color table settings will open the color table based on the template attached to the\\nchosen object.\\nDelete will delete the object permanently.\\nExport will open the export dialog for the selected object.

Find the cell centers of the seismic cube specified as the Seismic resolution cube. The seismic\\ncell is defined by a hexahedron centered on the sample point/node in the seismic cube.\\n2. Identify the property cells in which the seismic cell centers are located.\\nWhen Interpolate is OFF, the value of the property cell in which the seismic cell center falls inside\\nis assigned directly to the cell in the output cube.\\nWhen Interpolation is specified, continue with the following steps.\\n3. Split the property cell, including the seismic sample point (seismic cell center) into 5\\ntetrahedrons.\\n4. Calculate the corner values for the tetrahedron holding the seismic sample point. Each corner is\\nsurrounded by 8 property cells and the value is taken as the arithmetic mean of the 8 cell values.\\nLet's say we want to calculate the value of the corner marked in red below. This is identical to the\\nupper left corner of property cell a. It is surrounded by cells a, b, c and d in this specific K layer. It\\nis also surrounded by 4 cells with similar I, J positions in the K layer above. The corner value will\\nbe the arithmetic mean of the 8 cells identified as the closest neighbors.\\n5. Map the seismic sample point and tetrahedron to a unit space tetrahedron and interpolate. The\\ntetrahedron including the sample point is transformed to a local coordinate system where the\\nlength of each side is one unit.\\nThe sketch below illustrates the transformation in a two dimensions:\\nThe formula for calculating the interpolated value at the sample point (red spot) within the unit\\nspace tetrahedron is given above.\\n6. The interpolated value is assigned to the actual seismic sample point.\\n7. Repeat the process for all sample points forming the seismic resolution cube.\\nMake maps from properties (Operations tab)\\nThe operations available on this tab depend on the property type, discrete (for example, facies) or\\ncontinuous (for example, porosity). All of these operations create a new surface in the Input\\npane. To specify the resolution and extents of the surface, drop an existing surface with the\\nrequired geometry into the dialog. If none is given, a default geometry will be created.\\nMake average map - Creates a surface with the volume weighted average value of the\\nproperty at each XY location. There are options to smooth the result (this will remove some\\nof the effects of the grid structure and give a better result) and to expand the result such\\nthat fault gaps are filled.\\nMake volume height maps - Creates a surface representing the integral of the property\\nwith respect to elevation divided by the cell volume at each XY location. When performed on\\nvolume properties (porosity, STOIIP, etc.) this represents the volume per unit area in the\\nchosen zone at that point. There is an option to smooth the result.\\nMake net map - Creates a surface representing the sum of the property multiplied by the\\nheight at each point. With volume proportion properties (L3/L3) such as Net to Gross this\\nrepresents the effective thickness of the unit.\\nMake water table map - Create a water table making use of hydraulic head values.\\n(for each zone) - each of the above operations also has a similar option which allows the\\nuser to make one map per zone in a single operation.\\nMake surface attribute property map - Extracts the property values from the selected\\nproperty along the selected surface.\\nA top sand map for tarbert2 in the Gullfaks field.\\nMore tab (Individual Properties)\\nOn the More tab, the user has the option to smooth the property across the boundary between\\ntwo facies. This can be useful for removing the sharp property contrasts in the model which, in\\nturn, can give the simulator problems.\\nChoose the facies model to be applied to guide the areas to smooth and the two facies codes to\\nsmooth between. There are three options available for controlling which side of the boundary the\\nproperty should be smoothed on. To the right, there are diagrams illustrating the effect.\\nOperations on Well logs\\nThere are two options available in the Operations tab on wells; to eliminate the well above or\\nbelow a certain Z-value and to smooth the log. These operations can be perfomred globally for all\\nwells or for one specific well at a time.\\nTo do this globally, open the Settings window for the Wells folder. To do this for a specific\\nwell, open the Settings window for a Well file.\\nTo eliminate a section of the well, choose the appropriate cutoff values and press Eliminate. To\\nsmooth a zig-zagged well, press Smooth. Zig-zagging may be caused by importing the file with\\ntoo few data points, this is a particular problem when importing from simulators. Check the\\nAdjust MD values checkbox if MD values were not read in during well import.\\nUse of calculator\\nThe calculator can be used on the wells in two different ways:\\nGlobally - use the calculator from the pull-down menu of the Global Well Logs folder.\\nIndividually - use the calculator from the pull-down menu of a specific Well file.\\nThe calculator can be used to create new logs, for example, use a Porosity log and a simple\\nformula to create a synthetic Permeability log. For more information and examples of how to use\\nthe calculator, see Well Log Calculator.\\nNote that each log should be attached to the correct template. The template can be defined\\nglobally (for all wells) from the Settings window of the Global Well Logs folder, or individually for\\na specific well from the Settings window of the Well. The template can be changed under the Info\\ntab, option Attach to template - for details see Templates and Well Logs.\\nLookup curves\\nLookup curves can be used to define transformations and can then be used in the calculators or\\nas part of the operations on an object. The number to be transformed will represent the X value\\nof the function and the function will return the corresponding Y value. This is written in the\\ncalculator in the form:\\nFunctionName(x)\\nFunctions can be imported as a table of X,Y data (see Import Functions (Lookup curves)) or\\ngenerated interactively in Petrel by right-clicking on the function folder and choosing Insert new\\nfunction. See Functions.\\nQuality Control of processed data\\nIt is important to check the statistics whenever you have performed any processing operations.\\nAlways compare statistics before and after the operation to check if the results seem logical.\\nEach data object has some statistical information accounted for in the Statistics tab of its\\nSettings window.

       "  'content': 'Figure 1. The property filter tab.\\nUsing Property Filters in Petrel\\nThere are several ways of quality checking a generated property model. The techniques for\\nfiltering on property models are excellent quality control tools. For improved graphical\\nperformance, it helps to switch off some of the segments or zones from the Segment Filter or the\\nZone Filter. The Histogram and Statistics are also tools for improved quality control. Both\\nHistogram and Statistics are filter sensitive in respect to zones and segments. Also the calculator\\nfor making property models is filter sensitive by option.\\nUnder the Properties folder there is a filter option where the user may filter on property models.\\nThe filter is a tool for hiding grid cells, honoring given criteria for display. Open the Filter tab from\\nthe Settings window of the Properties folder (double click the Properties folder). A combination of\\ndifferent and/or several filters may be used.\\nThe property filter includes Use Segment and Zone filters as an option. These filters have to be\\nset for the grid in Petrel Explorer.\\nThere is also an option to invert the filters that are set with the Invert total filter option. This gives\\nthe possibility to quickly visualize opposite filter settings.\\nUpscaled logs filter\\nFiltering on the cells penetrated by the wells. Only selected wells with the cells penetrated by the\\nwell path will be visualized.\\nThis filter is only available for properties that have been distributed on the basis of well logs that\\nhave been up-scaled.\\nSeveral possibilities are available for the Upscaled logs filter:\\nAlways Include: The upscaled logs are always included in the filter, even for the property\\nplayer. (This is the default setting).\\nExclude: The upscaled logs are excluded from the property, i.e. not shown.\\nAs Normal Cells: The upscaled logs are not treated in any special way, i.e. they are regarded as\\npart of the 3D property.\\nOnly: Cells in the property that are not part of the upscaled logs are filtered away enabling you to\\nvisualize the upscaled well logs only.\\nSpecial 1 and 2: This option allows the user to set a volume (1 or 2 cells) around each upscaled\\nwell to invisible. The upscaled cells will be visualized. By using the invert total filter option, the\\nundefined volume will be visualized.\\nIndex filter\\nThe effect of using the Index filter is similar to creating a fence diagram. The filter is based on the\\nindexing of the cells in the 3D grid.\\nTo use the Index filter, toggle on the Use Index Filter box at the top of the Filter tab.\\nThe Index filter is a combination of three different filters - one for each main direction of the grid:\\nI, J, and K.\\nThe I checkbox indicates how to filter cells with the same I index number.\\nThe J checkbox indicates how to filter cells with the same J index number.\\nThe K checkbox indicates how to filter cells with the same index number.\\nThe parameters Min, Start, Width, Skip and Max determine which cells will be shown. The And/Or\\ncheckboxes are additional criteria. If the top And/Or is on, only the intersections between the\\nselected I and K cells will be shown. If both And/Or checkboxes are on, only the intersection of\\nthe selected I, J, and K cells will be shown.\\nMin: No cells with an index number less than \"Min\" will be displayed.\\nStart: Index of the first I/J/K cells to be visualized.\\nWidth: How many consecutive rows of cells to be shown.\\nSkip: How many rows of cells to skip (not to show).\\nMax: Rows with an index larger than Max will not be shown.\\nExample for I and J: Start = 21, Width = 2, Skip = 4, Max = 33\\nI21, I22 are shown. I23, I24, I25, I26 are not shown. I27, I28 are shown, etc. The same numbers\\nare shown for J.\\nValue filter\\nValue filter (filtering on cell values): Use the two cut-off bars to change the cut off values. Select\\nthe property from the list of available properties. Check the Use filter and move the arrows to get\\nthe range of values you want to display, or type in the min and max values for a given property.\\nIf your value filter shows a negative min value for a property, where you would not expect it, e.g.\\nfor porosity or the bulk volume, the negative cell values may be graphically displayed by typing in\\n0 for the max value.\\nThe value filter can be used in a number of different combinations, where value limits can be set\\nfor a number of different properties and only property cells that fulfill the conditions set for all the\\ndifferent properties will be displayed. This can be of particular interest for calculations of volumes\\nof the filtered cells only.\\nNote that if the value filter is set for one property, all other properties that are visualized will\\nalso only display cells that fulfill the value limit set for the first property. The value filter will have\\nto be set inactive or reset in the Filter tab to be able to display all the cells again.\\nHow to set value filter for more than one property\\n1.\\n2.\\n1. Open the filter by double clicking on the Property folder of a 3D Grid. In the Settings\\nwindow select the Filter tab.\\n2. Toggle on Use value filter under Filter settings.\\n3. In Value filter, select the first property, click on Use filter and set the max and min value\\nfor this property.\\n4. Select the next property and set the max and min values to be displayed and repeat for all\\nthe properties that a limit needs to be set for.\\n5. When all necessary value limits are set, click OK.\\n6. In Petrel Explorer, visualize a property and the cells displayed will fulfill all the conditions\\nset in the value filter.\\nVisible filter\\nThis filter is based on the Generic filters applied on what is displayed in the active 3D window\\n(for detailed information see Generic Filters). This could be used to perform operations on a\\nspecific cell layer, segment or zone. It is especially useful to use in workflows using the Workflow\\neditor.\\nDefined values only\\nThe filter is based on the selected property in the menu. All cells with a property value between\\nthe Max and Min values will be displayed.\\nAll the cells with undefined values are displayed in gray if this filter is not in use.\\nOther filter options\\nInvert total filter: Option to invert the filter. Will invert all applied filters.\\nUse Segment / Zone filter: Option to choose whether to use the segment/zone filters or not.\\nUse Local Grid filter: Applies the Local grid filter created when using the Make Local Grids\\nprocess under Structural Modeling.\\nFilter away 0 volumes: If toggled off, all cells will be shown, even if they have 0 volume. If\\ntoggled, only cells with volume greater than 0 will be visualized (default). The option Defined\\nvalues only has to be toggled in order to be able to choose this filter option.\\nFiltering with Property Player\\nA useful way of viewing your modeling results is by using the property player in Petrel. The\\nproperty player will go through each layer, row or column, step by step or by animation. It is used\\nas an automatic index filter, making it convenient to quickly browse through your results. It works\\ntogether with intersection planes that can narrow down the areas for your quality control. All\\nfiltering techniques that are applicable to property models will work together with the property\\nplayer. It is however, not recommended to use the index filter (in the property filter tab), during\\nthis operation since this can make the entire property invisible in the property player.\\nHow to use the property player: See Property Player.'},\n",

When importing well data in the supported well formats, Petrel\\nautomatically saves the data in appropriate folders and sub-folders in the panes in Petrel. The\\ngeneral workflow for importing well data into Petrel is:\\n1. Import of well heads\\n2. Insert well path/deviation data\\n3. Add logs to the wells\\nFor more details on these steps, see Well import\\nThis system ensures flexibility and accuracy in the import. The procedure allows for multiple well\\nimports, easy update of previously imported wells, and the option to further organize the\\nimported wells in sub folders.\\nWell trace and well logs are stored independently, which allows logs with different sampling\\nintervals to be attached to the same well trace. This may have an effect when using the\\ncalculator.\\nThe supported formats for well trajectory data and/or logs are:\\nWell heads from spreadsheet.\\nDeviation data from spreadsheet.\\nIRAP RMS wells trajectories and logs.\\nPetro works SM1 wells trajectories and logs.\\nGeneral ASCII format for well(s) with associated log(s) (simple well & log and multiple wells\\nand logs)\\nProduction and observed data from spreadsheet.\\nBitmap logs (images)\\nCheckshots from ASCII format\\nCompletion logs for wells with associated event and tubing data logs\\nComment logs.\\nInternal Petrel binary format for use in the project model.\\nGlobal Well Logs and Well Log Templates\\nIt is important to organize the well data to keep the project tidy and in order. Well data has a\\ngreat impact on the resulting volume output and should therefore be given special care.\\nEach log type present in a project will be listed in the Global well logs folder in the Petrel\\nInput pane.\\nEach global well log should be attached to the correct template.\\nEach individual log should be attached to the correct global well log.\\nDuring import of well logs, Petrel will try to match logs with previously imported logs (i.e. global\\nwell logs). A log with the same name as that of a global well log is assigned the template of that\\nglobal well log. The user may override the selection and/or change templates and global well logs\\nafter import.\\nIf wells are imported using the IRAP RMS format, the log names will be assigned automatically for\\nthose logs recognized by the program. The rest are imported with a General template. This\\nshould be changed after import to a template representing the type of the well log.\\nFor more information on how Petrel handles well logs and a description of available well log\\ntemplates, see Templates and well logs.\\nHow to edit a well log\\'s name and template\\n1. Open the Global well logs folder (a sub-folder to the Wells folder).\\n2. Rename the global well log (the node) directly or....\\n3. ...double click on the name of the global well log to edit to open the log\\'s settings window.\\nSelect the Info tab and change the log\\'s name and template as appropriate.\\nHow to create a new global well log and attach logs to it\\n1. Right-click on the Global well logs folder and Insert one of the many data types\\navailable (continuous, discrete, comment, combined, and more).\\n2.\\n1.\\n2. Edit the name and template for the global well log as appropriate (see above).\\nHow to set Well Type\\n1. Double-click the well to open the settings for the well.\\n2. Select the Info tab.\\n3. Change the \\'Well symbol\\' for the well from the drop down menu.\\nThe set of symbols to choose from can also be changed. See Well Symbols\\nData structure for well data\\nPetrel offers an easy way of organizing the well data. When working on projects with many wells,\\nit is essential to keep the project tidy. The user can choose to organize the wells in the Wells\\nfolder by\\n1. Creating sub folders. Simply click with the right mouse button on the well folder and select\\n\\'Insert folder\\' from the context menu.\\n2. Use the \\'Saved searches\\' functionality to temporarily sort well data matching a certain criteria\\n(see Saved searches)\\nThe wells can be imported directly into a sub folder or the user can \"drag and drop\" selected wells\\ninto specific folders. To select more than one well, press and hold the Shift key while selecting the\\nwells and drag and drop all in one step. By renaming the sub folders and organizing the wells, the\\nuser can create a structured setup for all wells. In addition, the settings for each sub folder can be\\nset separately.\\nSub-folders and organization can also be performed using the Well Manager.\\nImport well heads\\nThe recommended way to import wells in Petrel is to start with the well heads, then append the\\ndeviation data and finally the well logs.\\nwell head file is simply an ASCII file containing well header information organized in columns\\n(attributes). By default Petrel will expect 6 columns of information in the well header file,\\nhowever, the user may add as many additional custom attributes as required. A new date\\nattribute can be specified according to the format of the computers regional settings or in any\\ncustom format.\\nOnce the well header information has been imported into Petrel, they are stored in a Well\\nattributes folder under the main Wells folder. There are 15 default system attributes available in\\nthe attribute list:\\nName - the well name - required (must be unique) (string attribute)\\nUWI - the unique well identifier - optional (string attribute)\\nWell symbol - label for the well type - optional (discrete attribute)Surface X coordinate - the\\nX location (in project units) of the well at the well head - required (continuous attribute)\\nSurface Y coordinate - the Y location (in project units) of the well at the well head - required\\n(continuous attribute)\\nKelly Bushing (KB) value - the Z value (in project units) of the Kelly Bushing - required\\n(continuous attribute)\\nTD (TVD) - the vertical depth value (in project units) of the last point in the well - required\\n(continuous attribute)\\nTD (MD) - the measured depth value (in project units) of the last point in the well - required\\n(continuous attribute)\\nTop depth (MD) - optional.\\nBottom depth (MD) - optional.\\nMax INC - the value of the highest inclination from vertical (in project units) in the well path\\n- optional (continuous attribute). This attribute is calculated in Petrel and is a useful\\nattribute for distinguishing among vertical, inclined and horizontal wells.\\nCost - the cost of the well - optional (string attribute).\\nSpud date - the date the well was spudded - optional (date attribute)\\nOperator - the name of the organization operating the well - optional (string attribute)\\nSimulation name\\nZ - depth value\\nTWT auto - time value\\nUser - user defined well attribute - optional (any type of attribute)\\nIf information on the well trace is absent (e.g. only coordinates and KB is available) the user could\\ndefine a TD (Total depth) attribute . The program will then draw the well trace vertically within\\nthe depth interval specified. See Well Heads (*.*) format for an example.\\nPlease note that symbol names should be written as ONE word in the well head file, i.e. remove\\nall empty spaces. The word may contain extra commas, underscores, etc. Each symbol name can\\nbe represented by its corresponding number (see list) instead of the name.\\nUnits in the file can be converted at import.\\nA list of well symbols that Petrel recognizes:\\nThe set of symbols to choose from can also be changed. See Well Symbols\\nCreate new well\\nUse the Insert | New well folder from the main menu if there is no well folder present in the\\nproject. Then from the same Insert menu a new well can be created. A new well can also be\\ncreated by clicking with the right mouse button on the Wells folder or a sub folder inside the well\\nfolder, and select New well from the pull down menu. . If the new well is not placed in the\\ncorrect well folder, use \"drag and drop\" to place the well in the correct sub folder.\\nWhen creating a new well a dialog will appear asking for name, coordinates, KB value and well\\nsymbol. Trace and length of trace (vertical) may be defined. The input figures may be converted\\nto project units if different. Enter desired information and click OK. These specifications may be\\nchanged later from the Settings window of the well or by using the Well Manager tool.\\nHow to import a well head file\\nFor more info on the steps in the import procedure, see Well data are imported in three steps:\\nThe import dialog for well header files allows the import of an unrestricted amount of attributes\\nfor each well (see ). Attributes can be of several types including string, continuous, discrete and\\ndate.\\nGo to the File pull down menu and select Import file , or right-click the Wells folder and\\nselect Import (on selection)... from the context menu.\\n1. Select \\'Well Heads (*.*)\\' as files of type.\\n2. Select the file to import and click Open.\\n3. The import dialog opens. A sample of the import file will be shown at the bottom of the\\ndialog.\\n4. Define which columns that correspond to what information in the file.\\n5. Enter the number of header files (if any) and set the value for undefined value (default is -\\n999).\\n6. Click OK.\\n5.\\n6.\\nThe well header information can be found individually for each well by viewing the settings for the\\nwell or by using the Well Manager tool.\\nImport well path deviation\\nImport of well path/deviation data is the second step in the well import process. To learn the\\nstandard import steps, see Well import\\nThe deviation file can be imported well by well, for several wells together or for multiple wells in\\none file. If multiple wells are included in a single file there are a series of options for determining\\nhow the settings for different wells are distinguished, see Multiple Well Log Formatsfor details.\\nNote that a deviation file can be loaded before or after the logs have been loaded. The\\ndeviation file may also be exchanged for another one - just load a new deviation file and it will\\nreplace the old one.\\nThe deviation file should be in ASCII format with the data organized in columns. Data can be of\\nseveral types:\\nMeasured depth, inclination, azimuth\\nTrue vertical depth, X-offset, Y-offset (MD optional)\\nTrue vertical depth, X, Y (MD optional)\\nX, Y, Z (MD optional)\\nAngles can be Deg or Rad, azimuth (in degrees) should be between -360 and 360, inclination (in\\ndegrees) between 0 and 90, 0 being vertical, 90 horizontal.\\nDeviation files with data listed in the reversed order are auto-detected and reversed in the import\\nprocess. The detection is based on that the first MD value in a reversed file is greater than the\\nlast. See Well Path/Deviation (formats) for an example.\\nWell Import in Petrel (vs GeoFrame)\\nIf the well is imported using MD, dip and azimuth then the resulting well path (XYZ) is calculated\\nusing the same method as that used in GeoFrame and the well should be in the same place. The\\nonly remaining issue is that with no coordinate system in Petrel, scale factors are ignored and this\\ncan result in discrepancies when going from true meters in measured depth to meters in XY in the\\nproject space.\\nIf the well is imported in X, Y, Z or dX, dY, Z then dip azimuth and most importantly MD\\n(assuming MD is not given) must be calculated using a minimum curvature model from the initial\\npoints. This problem has non unique solutions so errors may occur in this case irrespective of how\\ngood the data is. It is recommended that MD is always included in the file if available.\\nWhen MD is not available, the result is sensitive to the initial direction of the well before the first\\npoint. This is varied and the minimum curvature method used to model the well path and match it\\nto the available data. If a solution is not found then a linear interpolation is used and this fact will\\nbe documented in the statistics page of the well. In most cases (all \\'sensible\\' cases) a solution will\\nbe found. If a solution is found, then exporting the well trace and re-importing it using any of the\\ninterpolation mechanisms will give the same result.\\nImporting onshore or offshore wells\\nIn Petrel all coordinate values below sea level are negative and coordinate values above sea level\\nare positive. To make sure the well files are imported correctly, the user has to specify whether\\nthe wells are onshore or offshore:\\nIf a well is offshore but the vertical coordinates are positive, then Petrel will multiply them\\nall by -1. If the well is onshore, then they will be left as they are.\\nIf the well has most of its vertical well path onshore, then it is an onshore well, even if the\\nreservoir is below sea level.\\nIf you are uncertain whether the well is onshore or offshore, you should import it as an\\nonshore well. This option will usually always work. However, do use the offshore option if you\\nknow you are working with offshore wells because this option allows for more checks of the data\\nwhen they are imported.\\nImport settings for deviation files\\nBecause there are several types of deviation files, the file imported needs to be specified. There\\nare four tabs in the import dialog with various settings. The hints tab contains some general\\ninformation.\\nInput Data tab\\nWhen importing files with MD or TVD, the user should specify a reference level (Kelly Bushing,\\nMean Sea Level or other).\\nIf the lines in the file are wrapped, this should be specified also, defining how many columns\\n(tokens per line) there are per measurement point.\\nSettings tab\\nExtend well trace: To extend the well trace, an option to \\'Add top\\' and \\'Add bottom\\' point\\nis given. It will add length in project units (positive number) following the tangents at the\\nend points.\\nWell tops: Ther eis a default option to move well tops and well top attributes with the well\\nas it is shifted up or down.\\nOther: When there are no MD values present in the input file, the option Curved trace\\nabove MD can be checked and a measured depth value at first point can be added.\\nUnits tab\\nUnits: If the units in the import file are different from the project units, this must be\\nspecified at import (required to calculate the trace properties).\\nOther: If MD, azimuth and inclination are used as input, select degrees or radians in this\\ntab.\\nHow to import deviation data for one well\\n1. Click with the right mouse button on the well to be deviated to open the pull-down menu.\\n2. Select Import (on selection). The import dialog will appear.\\n3. Select Well path/deviation ASCII (*.*) as files of type.\\n4. Select the deviation survey file. Click Open. The import dialog will pop up.\\n5.

The deviation survey import dialog.\\nHow to import deviation data for multiple wells\\nTo be able to apply deviation for several wells in one go, each deviation file should have the same\\nname as the well it is related to. The program will try to match the name of the import file with a\\nwell present in the well folder and present a suggestion of matching pairs in the import dialog.\\nThat way the user can make sure that each well is matched with its correct deviation file and\\ncorrect if a mismatch has occurred.\\n1.

Click with the right mouse button on the Wells folder or on a sub folder to open the pull-\\ndown menu.\\n2. Select \\'Import (on selection)\\'. The import dialog will appear.\\n3. Select Well path/deviation or Multiple well paths/deviations (ASCII) (*.*) as files of type.\\n4. Select the appropriate files. Click Open. The import dialog will pop up.\\n5. Make sure that the wells are correctly matched with the deviation file names - and that the\\n% naming is correct.\\nNote: If a branch well name is detected, Petrel will assign a parent-branch relationship only\\nif there is a physical intersection point between the two traces.\\nImport logs\\nWhen the well has been imported with the well head data and deviation survey, it is ready for\\nimport of well logs. Well logs in ASCII format require that the logs are listed in columns in the\\nASCII file with a space or tab delimitation. The input log file may have a header - the number of\\nheader lines will be detected automatically. The log file can be imported well by well, for several\\nwells together or for multiple wells in one file.\\nNote that logs can be loaded at any time and added to well with previous logs. Logs on the\\nsame well trace can have different sampling interval.\\nLog files with data listed in reverse order are auto-detected and reversed in the import\\nprocess.

The user will then be asked at\\nimport whether the log files and well heads have been correctly matched and make\\nadjustments if needed.\\nIf the logs are imported from a LAS 2.0 file, the import file is scanned and the program tries\\nto determine which logs are present by checking the header. Standard LAS log names will\\nbe recognized.\\nLogs recognized and that already exist in the Global well logs folder will automatically be\\nassigned the correct template (although the user may override the selection).\\nLog import settings\\nThe import dialog for well logs has four tabs: Input data, Settings, Units and Hints. The Hints tab\\nshows general import information.\\nInput data\\nThe user must specify data type at import. Most commonly, the logs are stored together with\\nmeasured depth and this is the default option. If a well has been imported with its trace\\n(deviation data), and logs are imported together with X and Y information, the X and Y\\ncoordinated must match, otherwise the program will give an error message.\\nThe well trace must be defined before importing logs using X and Y information. If the match\\nis close but not perfect, the log value will be projected to the closest point on the already existing\\nwell trace. This could potentially be a source for errors in the log data imported - please be careful\\nwhen using this option!\\nData type: Select data type and columns where data types are found (see file capture at bottom\\nof dialog).\\nLogs that are not recognized will be given a general line in the spreadsheet. The user must then\\nspecify name and select template or global well log.\\nLogs: Petrel will try to autodetect the well logs in the import dialog, but this can be overridden by\\nthe user by selecting the Specify logs to be loaded. Logs with recognized names are listed by\\nname. If a recognized log exists as a global well log, it is automatically connected to that global\\nwell log. The template is then defined and cannot be changed as long as the log is connected to a\\nglobal well log. To be able to change the template, the global well log must be redefined to\\nCreate New - select from the pull down menu in the Global well logs column.\\nIt is important to check that the logs are related to the correct column number of the input file.\\nUse the file capture at the bottom of teh input dialog to identify the correct column for each log.

They\\nare interpreted or created in Petrel. alternatively they can be imported into Petrel based on the\\nfunction of their position (X, Y, Z coordinates), their name and the well they belong to. In\\naddition, they can contain other information, such as the Interpreter's name, measured depth,\\ntime values, average properties for a zone, etc. Wells are also assigned to one of several types,\\nhorizon, fault etc. (see Make/edit well tops for more information about types).\\nWell Tops have a pre-defined folder. The reason for this is that Well Tops are both stored as\\nbelonging to a type e.g. a horizon or a fault and also stored depending on which well the point\\nbelongs to. If one doesn't exist in your project, insert it using Insert | New well tops\\nWell tops, point well data, check shots and points with attributes are all imported in the same\\nformat, using the same dialog with a few modifications see Importing point data.\\nWell tops and checkshot data can be imported with one file for each well or with a single file\\nfor all wells. If no column is defined as holding the well name, then Petrel will assume that a\\nsingle file is used for each well and will attempt to guess which existing well a file belongs to,\\nbased on the file name. The user can override this by typing in a well name. If a column is defined\\nas well name then these options are grayed out.\\nWell Manager after import\\nAfter import, the wells contain a lot of information from the well attributes, imported logs etc.The\\nwell manager is a tool that collects all the information associated with each wellbore and presents\\nit in a spreadsheet format.\\nSee The well manager for more information.\\nHow to use the Well Manager tool\\n1. Right click on the Wells folder and select View well manager from the context menu.\\n2. The dialog will display all wells in the project, one row for each well, with all attributes. Use\\nthe toolbar at the top and bottom to edit, filter and handle well attribute information.\\n3. For project with a large number of wells it can be advantageous to use the Folder filter\\ndrop-down option at the top of the dialog to filter the well manager tool to only show wells\\nbelonging to a sub-folder in your project.\\n4. Alternatively, you can use an active Saved searches to limit the wells in view to a\\npredefined search criteria (see Saved searches).\\n5.

Right click on the Saved searches folder and select New search from the context menu.\\n2. In the dialog that opens you can add the search criteria to apply for the saved search. The\\nfollowing search criteria can be selected:\\nMatch primary well identifier: searches for wells that meet the preferred name\\ncriteria specified\\nWell log data: searches for all wells that have the logs or completions specified.\\nWell attributes: searches for all wells that have the attributes within the range\\nspecified. Several attribute filters can be specified in the same search.\\nUser specified list: use this search for custom lists. It is possible to generate the\\nsearch from wells displayed in the active view.\\nWell tops: uses the well top Stratigraphy\\nWithin boundary: searches for wells whose trace lies with a specified polygon or\\npolygon set\\n3. Press Apply to store the search. To make the search work, simply toggle it on under the\\nSaved search folder.\\nHow to update/combine saved searches\\nThere are several ways in which the search can be updated. In the settings dialog for Saved\\nsearch, the following options are available and are applied to all the saved searches defined:\\nApply search to:\\nTree: applies the searches to the Petrel Input pane only (views are not updated with search\\ncriteria). It is not possible to synchronize the views if this option is selected.\\nActive window (or All windows): applies the search(es) to the Petrel Input pane and the\\nactive viewer (or all viewers). When wells are displayed in the active window and a search is\\napplied, all wells not meeting the search criteria are removed from view. The Petrel Input\\npane removes all wells not meeting the criteria but does not turn on automatically the wells\\nmeeting the search criteria. It is always possible to show only the wells that meet the\\nsearch criteria by selecting the Synchronize view check box. Note that in situations where\\nwindows have been applied with a visual link to another window, this setting will take\\nprecedence over the saved searches.\\nMultiple searches:\\nAND: If this is toggled only one search will work at any given time.\\nOR: If this is toggled two searched will work together.\\nNOT: If more than one search is toggled, only the topmost search will work (highest\\npriority). To change priority, move searches to the top of the folder (drag-and-drop).\\nImport Lines and Points\\nPetrel supports various formats for line and point data and, in addition, has a general reader that,\\nwith some user-defined settings, can import any ASCII data set.\\nIRAP classic lines, ASCII\\nIRAP classic lines, BINARY\\nIRAP classic points, ASCII\\nZmap+ lines, ASCII\\nZmap+ fault traces, ASCII\\nCPS-3 lines, ASCII\\nCharisma lines, ASCII\\nCharisma fault sticks, ASCII\\nSeisworks fault sticks, ASCII\\nSeisworks horizon picks, ASCII\\nIESX 2D/3D seismic lines\\nIESX fault polygons\\nIESX fault sticks\\nKingdom 2D/3D seismic lines\\nKingdom fault sticks\\nGeneral reader for XYZ data for lines and points, ASCII\\nLine data\\nimported into Petrel can, for example, be seismic interpretations, fault polygons, fault lines,\\ncontour data or cultural data, like block and license boundaries.\\nPoint data\\nimported into Petrel will normally be various point data from Wells, but can also be e.g. points\\nrepresenting the nodes in a grid. For the best use of Petrel we recommend that formation\\ntops and fault points be imported into Petrel as Well Tops, see Make/Edit well tops.\\nNote that Line data in Petrel is treated as points with a line through. Therefore, points can\\nbe converted directly to lines and vice versa.\\nHow to import Lines and/or Points\\nCreate a folder for the data to import in the Input pane, by clicking on Insert new folder in\\nthe Toolbar.\\n1.

If Petrel does not recognize the format of the data file, e.g. if the wrong\\nformat has been chosen, an error message will pop up when importing the file.\\nFigure 1. The input data dialog.\\nIt is important to know the format of the data to be able to use the defined formats. If the\\nformat of lines or points is not known, the files can be compared with the format examples in\\nAppendix 1 - Formats. For formats not supported by Petrel, the General data reader for lines and\\npoints can be used to import the data, as long as the data are in ASCII format.\\nGeneral lines/points reader - Settings\\nThe General data reader for lines and points gives the possibility to import lines and points into\\nPetrel on a general ASCII format. In the dialog for the general reader the first 30 lines of the file\\nare viewed and number of header lines and the columns for X, Y and Z must be specified. It might\\nbe useful to view more than the first 30 lines of the file e.g. to find flag values, in that case it is\\nrecommended to open the file in an editor, e.g. Notepad or Word Pad.\\nIn the dialog these settings must be specified:\\nNumber of header lines\\nNumber of lines before the data listing starts.\\nNewline value\\nThis is a value that normally indicates a new line or a new cluster of points. The number will\\nbe the same for X, Y and Z. The number -999 is usually used. If there is no flag value in the\\nfile, use 0. If a flag value is present without being specified, Petrel cannot distinguish between\\nthis value and real values.\\nUndefined Z-value\\nThis value indicates that a data point is not of real value. This is normally a very large\\nnumber, e.g. 1.0E10. If no undefined value is present, use 0.\\nRead as\\nSpecify whether the file should be read as lines or points. If the file is read as lines then all\\npoints between flag values will be connected.\\nX-, Y- and Z-value column\\nIndicates which column in the file the X-, Y- and Z- values are listed. For the Z-value three\\nsettings can be selected. If no Z-values are present, Petrel will set all Z-values to 0. If some\\nZ-values are present, Petrel will set the missing Z-values to 0.\\nHow to use the General lines/points reader\\n.To export horizons from a 3D grid created in Petrel, they can be converted to a surface using the\\ni, j grid of the Horizon. To export IsoChore maps in Petrel, they first have to be made from the\\nzones created in the 3D grid.\\nFaults can be converted to polygons, which are sorted by fault or by horizon. To make fault\\npolygons sorted per fault, the conversion is done from the Fault folder. To make fault polygons\\nsorted per horizon, the conversion is initiated from the Fault filter folder. To export faults from a\\n3D grid as fault surfaces they first have to be converted to regular 2D grids.\\nNote that the default settings may be overwritten so that the user is always free to choose\\nexactly what to export. Also note that the name of a fault is restricted to 8 characters in ECLIPSE.\\nTo export horizons from a 3D grid created in Petrel, they can be converted to a surface with a\\nregular grid (x,y).

Some differences are essential and these are discussed under the sections of the\\nspecific objects.\\nCreate a folder for the data by clicking on Insert new folder in the Toolbar.\\nHow to import cultural data\\nAny type of cultural data of the ASCII format can be read into Petrel by using the General\\nlines/points reader. When cultural data is imported into Petrel, all Z-values are set to zero. To be\\nable to view cultural data together with depth data, Z-values for the cultural data can be assigned\\nin Petrel, see Operations.\\nNote: Cultural data can also be imported using plug-ins.\\n1.

Note that the global (e.g. UTM) location will be lost in the exported grid if\\nLocal coordinate system is selected.\\n3. Select if keywords are to be included in the file (only ECLIPSE and CMG).\\n4. For ECLIPSE, the Export MAPAXES keyword option saves the origin and axes information\\nfor the Petrel grid. A rotation angle can also be defined.\\n5. For CMG, there are two options; either Export CORNERS keyword or Export COORD\\nkeyword. Use of the COORD keyword requires that the fault pillars are straight. The\\nkeyword CORNER is more flexible and allows any geometry of fault pillars.\\n6. Select User defined cell origin to specify the grid origin and cell order manually.\\nOtherwise, Petrel will try to find the grid origin/orientation and arrange the data thereafter.\\n7. To specify the cell order for the exported grid manually, the user needs to know the internal\\ncell numbering of the specific Petrel grid. The position of a Petrel cell is defined by the three\\nindices (I, J, K). The index K specifies the cell layer, and the top layer is always K=0. J and\\nI give the position in layer K.\\n8. If the option Set K to max K is selected, the bottom layer will be exported first.\\n9. The user specifies which cell in the layer to be exported first by selecting one of the four\\nCell origin options.\\n10. Finally, the direction J or I to traverse needs to be specified. This means, the reader/writer\\ntraverses the grid along the selected direction.\\n11.

For more information on how to use the tool, see the Reference project tool.\\nReference project tool\\nThe Reference project tool is designed to share data between projects. The Reference project tool\\nenables asset team collaboration by comparing data in two different projects in an easy to\\nunderstand manner, where groups of data can be filtered out and you can move subsets of data\\nitems between projects.\\nPrior to using the Reference project tool, your Data Manager should establish projects as\\nReference projects and follow the Petrel Data Management best practice procedure described in\\nthe Petrel Deployment guide (accessible from the Petrel download site (Help > Check for\\nupdates)), and aslo taught in the Petrel Data Management course. These are Petrel projects that\\nhave been designated as Reference Projects by saving the Petrel project with a .petR extension\\n(File > Save project as… > selecting Reference project files in the Save as type).\\nBuilding Petrel Template projects before using\\nthe Reference project tool\\nWhen you deploy Petrel into your environment or company, there are many initial steps and best\\npractices that you can put in place. These, in turn, will benefit the Data Manager controlling the\\nPetrel projects and the Petrel data flow. Recommended steps to follow would be to implement\\nbest practices for using the Reference project tool and reference projects and to standardize\\ncoordinate systems. These initiatives will improve the Petrel user experience and productivity.\\nIt is recommended to organize data into predefined folders in Petrel. To standardize this, a Petrel\\ntemplate project can be generated.\\nCreating a Petrel Template project\\nPrior to loading/importing data into Petrel, consider whether you would like to use a Petrel\\nTemplate project. To fully utilize the Reference project tool functionality it is recommended to\\nbuild Petrel Template projects. This template would be used by all Petrel users, similar to how a\\nMicrosoft Word (.dot) template is used so that everyone has the same look and feel for their\\ndocuments. Creating and using a Petrel Template project for all of your Petrel users has these\\nbenefits:\\n• Ensures easy data transfers since all user projects have a similar data structure.\\n• Provides each user with the same starting point.\\n• Propels each user towards organizing data in a consistent manner.\\n• Allows consistent data organization throughout a company.\\n• Allows for storage of standard organizational workflows (if existing).\\nHow to create a Petrel Template project\\n1. Create a new project in Petrel.\\n2. Set the coordinate system under the project settings.\\n3. Set the Seismic Reference datum (SRD).\\n4. Create the Template project folder structure within the Input pane.\\n5. Customize templates, create predefined windows, workflows, etc.\\n6. Save the project and name it to recognize it as a Template project. Store it in a location that is\\nshared and accessible to all users. Make sure the project is read-only for the users to prevent\\naccidental overwriting.\\n7. Make the stored Template project available for users. There are two ways of doing this:\\na. Send a short cut to the desktop for this Template project .pet file and rename the short cut\\n\"Petrel Template project\" or similar. Make it recognizable for the users that they will launch the\\nTemplate project.\\nb. It is also possible to edit the target field of the Petrel.exe file to point to this Template project.\\nGo to the Program files folder and send the Petrel.exe file as a short cut to the desktop, open the\\nsettings for the new short cut and edit the target field. Enter the full path of the Template project\\nand add quotes in the name of the Template project.\\nMake sure this is the only short cut to Petrel on the desktop. Both ways will force the users to\\nopen the Template project every time they want to run Petrel, meaning that no users should be\\nable to generate a project themselves from scratch.\\nThe use of Template projects is beneficial for the Reference project tool workflow since it will be\\neasier to recognize the folder structures between users.\\nHow to use the Reference project tool\\nThis section will describe how to transfer data between projects by the use of the Reference\\nproject tool. How to match and compare data before and after transferring and also explain any\\ndata specific considerations to have in mind while using the Reference project tool.\\nLaunching the Reference project tool\\nTo open the Reference project tool, go to Petrel\\'s File menu (Ctrl+M), and select Reference\\nproject tool . When the projects are properly launched within the Reference project tool window,\\nthe open Petrel project\\'s data will be displayed in the left pane, while the background project\\n(typically a reference project) will be displayed in the right pane. At this point, you can compare\\ndata between the two projects and transfer data back and forth.\\nYou can also launch the Reference project tool by clicking on a file name in the project\\nhistory under the File menu and keeping <Shift> pressed down at the same time. The selected\\nproject is opened as the background project in the Reference project tool.\\nChoosing the background project\\nYou can open any project as the background project (even if the extension is not .petR) by\\nclicking Open project in the top right-hand corner. Petrel is thorough in regards to opening\\nthe correct reference project and adheres to the following guidelines:\\n1. If you have only transferred data between the open project and one specific reference\\nproject, it will automatically be opened as the background project when you launch the\\nReference project tool.\\n2. If you have transferred data between the open project and more than one reference\\nproject, you will be prompted to choose which one you would like to set as the background\\nproject.\\n3. If you have not transferred data between the open project and a reference project, you will\\nbe prompted to open one from disk.\\nTransferring data between projects\\nYou can transfer data between the working project and the background project by simply\\nselecting the checkbox to the left of the data name. Note that the checkbox functionality is not\\nthe same as in the Input pane or the Models pane, where the selection will result in visualization\\nof the items in the Petrel display window.\\nOnce the data is selected for transfer, the arrows for moving the items (in the center of the tool)\\nturn blue and are activated. You can then transfer the data to the other project.\\nMultiple data items can be transferred across projects in a single transfer. Also, different data\\ntypes can be grouped in a single transfer, such as some items in the Input pane, some workflows\\nand some Models.\\nIf you want to select all data in the project for transfer, simply select the checkbox for the\\nhighest tree node in the project, which is the name of the project.\\nThe following are some guidelines about data transfers:\\n- When transferring data from the working project to the background project, the background\\nproject is automatically saved and data is overwritten when it exists. Transferring data to the\\nworking project does not automatically save the working project; the changes are only updated in\\nmemory. You must save (or \"Save As…\") the project to commit the changes. If you exit Petrel\\nwithout saving, the working project is not updated.\\n- Active filters (time stamp or advanced) are always taken into account when transferring data.\\nData selected but later filtered out will not be transferred.\\nTo disable two way transfers, you must make the background project a read-only project.\\nYou can do this by changing the disk-access permissions (make the files read-only or expose a\\nnetwork share folder with restricted permissions). This way, you can prevent accidental updates\\nto the background project while still allowing data to be transferred from it. Petrel will give a\\nwarning to make you aware if the background project is a read-only project.\\n- One difference between the Reference project tool and old data sharing functionality from the\\nsecondary project function from Petrel 2005 is that it is now possible to copy only one node in the\\nmiddle of a sub-tree if this is necessary. For example, it is possible to copy the well trace without\\nany of the logs. The checkbox selection allows you to select all the data in a folder with one click\\nand then unselect individual data that you do not want in the transfer.\\n- Certain objects can only be moved as a whole, for example some of the nodes and their content\\n(children) within Petrel\\'s Input or Models pane. The folders and data inside these objects are not\\nvisible in the Reference project tool dialog. An example of such an object is a velocity model. This\\nrestriction is necessary to ensure accurate data transfers.\\n- In general, when data is transferred between two projects, nothing will be deleted from the\\ntarget, meaning the transfer results only in additions and replacements. For example, when\\ntransferring a well trace, all the logs in the target project are preserved.\\n- When one node represents an entire sub-tree, the entire sub-tree in the target project will be\\nreplaced by the sub-tree in the source project. For example, in the case of the velocity model, this\\nincludes all the horizons.\\nData and folder synchronization\\nWhen you select data for transfer, Petrel may also select the data\\'s parent folder. If the parent\\nfolder does not exist in the destination project, Petrel will transfer the parent folder along with the\\ndata. If the folder already exists, Petrel will just transfer the data. This is called conditional\\nsynchronization.\\nWhen an item is selected, a purple tick mark appears next to the item and a black tick mark\\nappears by the parent data, as shown in the figure below:\\nA purple tick mark indicates a Normal Synchronization of data, meaning that the data will be\\ntransferred as a new object or will overwrite the object if it already exists in the destination\\nproject. The black tick mark indicates a Conditional Synchronization of the data, meaning the data\\nwill only be transferred if it does not already exist in the destination project. The conditional\\nsynchronization is required to parent the object correctly.\\nFor parent nodes, clicking on a purple \"Normal\" tick will turn it to a black Conditional\\nSynchronization. A third click will remove the check mark entirely. For those nodes that are not\\nparents, clicking on a purple \"Normal\" tick will remove the check mark entirely. The Details area\\nType field (at the bottom of the Reference project tool) indicates whether the data will be\\ntransferred as a Conditional or a Normal Synchronization.\\nWhen the object is updated in another project, meaning it already exists and is being\\noverwritten, the folder structure is not updated, even if there is a mismatch in the folder structure\\nbetween the two projects. This means that if well A10 exists in the working project\\'s \"Wells\"\\nfolder, but exists in the background project\\'s \"Wells - A\" sub-folder, updating well A10 in the\\nbackground project will still leave it in the \"Wells - A\" sub-folder.\\nEasily selecting logs for transfer\\nThe Reference project tool allows you to easily select the same well log in multiple wells for\\ntransfer without having to search within each well to specify the individual log.\\nTo easily transfer select well logs, follow this procedure:\\nOn the Reference project tool, click the log selector icon above the project you want to select logs\\nin.\\nThe title of the window indicates which project you are selecting logs in. In this example, the user\\nclicked the log selector icon above the Working Project.\\nThe Select logs window displays, showing a list of the well log types that are available in the\\nproject.\\nChoose the well log you want to select for transfer, and then click OK . The logs of the type you\\nchose will be selected in all the wells in the project where they appear. The wells will be selected\\nas conditional selections.\\nYou may want to select one type of log in all the wells, and another type of log in only a few wells.\\nThe log selector selects the log type you choose in all the wells; however, you can manually select\\nadditional well logs for transfer from a select number of wells.\\nIn this example, the user selected the Perm log for transfer from a small number of wells, then\\nused the log selector to mark the Gamma log for transfer from all wells. The log selector shows\\nthe Perm log as a partial selection as a black checkmark. The Gamma log is a complete selection\\nshown as the purple checkmark.\\nThe tool can also be used to unselect logs that are selected. Simply click the checkbox to clear it\\nand remove the log for selection.\\nChoose to not overwrite data when using the Reference project tool\\nYou can select an object or a group of objects to send or retrieve as a copy. This is valuable when\\nyou want to compare two similar objects in the same project, and you do not want to overwrite\\nthe original object. Objects transferred with the copy mode toggled on will be issued a new GUID\\ntherefore will not match with their counterpart. The full workflow for the complete comparison of\\ndata in the Referance project tool would be:\\n-highlight on both side\\n-compare details\\n-fetch as a copy\\n-compare in Petrel\\n-decide which one to keep\\n-delete copy\\n-fetch/send original\\nItems that are copied into a project are not meant to be stored there permanently. Rather, the\\ncopy function provides a way to compare data and decide which data object to keep and which\\none to discard.\\nTo copy an object, select the copy mode checkbox in the center of the Reference project tool.\\nSelect the items you want to copy from either project and make a normal transfer. Copy works in\\nboth directions.\\nThe copied items will get a \"Copy of\" prefix similar to the behavior in Windows Explorer. Only the\\nparent object in the transfer node will get the \"Copy of\" prefix. The other children items are\\ncopied, but not renamed.\\nSelect well A10 to transfer it as a copy to the background project so you do not overwrite it.\\nSelect the Copy mode checkbox to indicate that you want to send it as a copy.\\nClick the blue arrow to send the well to the background project.\\nCopy of A10\\nappears in the background project as a copy of the original well as shown below. Note that none\\nof the logs have the \"Copy of\" prefix. They are actual copies of the well\\'s logs, but none of the\\nobjects under the main node are given the \"Copy of\" prefix (just as in Windows Explorer).\\nIn the example below, the Well Tops 1 folder was selected for copy. It appears in the Reference\\nProject with the \"Copy of\" prefix in the main node heading. Note that none of the objects in the\\nCopy of Well Tops 1 folder have the \"Copy of\" prefix.\\nSome items can be copied, but the parent of the selected item is forcibly copied. For\\nexample, if you select a well log to be fetched as a copy, it is done, but the well is fetched as\\n\"Copy of\" well and the log is not renamed. Well tops and fault models are also fetched using this\\nmodel.\\nIn this example, the Perm log in the B2 well was copied to the background project. In the\\nbackground project, the well log is located under the B2 that is given the \"Copy of\" prefix. Also\\nnotice that Copy of B2 and its Perm log do not match any more with B2 and Perm in the working\\nproject (see purple icon in the background project) because both of them have been issued a new'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Chasing data\\nWhen transferring data, Petrel analyzes the data that has been selected for transfer and\\ndetermines if the data has dependencies on other data which should also be transferred. This is\\ncalled data chasing. These are mostly common sense dependencies. For example well logs cannot\\nexist without their well. If you transfer well logs, Petrel makes sure that their well is transferred in\\ncase it does not exist on the other side. In some other cases this dependency is not so trivial but -\\nthanks to data chasing - Petrel will take care of it. For instance if you transfer seismic data, its\\nvintage is automatically transferred even though you did not select it in the Reference project\\ntool. Another example is non-existing templates. If you transfer a log for instance, and its\\ntemplate does not exist on the other side, it will be automatically transferred by Petrel.\\nThere are some data that depend on other data that must be separately selected for transfer\\nbecause Petrel does not perform chasing automatically. You will need to select and transfer both\\n(or all) items to successfully update your target project. One example is when transferring seismic\\ninterpretation. As interpretations are linked to the survey folder (which stores the geometry) you\\nhave to transfer the survey folder first, and only after it is present in the working project, transfer\\nthe interpretation. Petrel will warn you when you have selected seismic data for transfer because\\nit requires additional selections to be complete. In addition to this, there are other dependencies\\nwhich are not chased by Petrel and they are not required. For example you can transfer a 3D\\nwindow without transferring all the objects that are visualized in it.\\nMatching and Comparing data\\nPetrel uses a simple matching rule to help guide you as to what data should be transferred. First,\\nit checks what data matches with the data in the other project. This matching is done by seeking\\na pair of data items that have the same Petrel identifier. Petrel uses globally unique identifiers\\n(GUIDs) to identify the data item. If a match is found, Petrel compares the time stamp of the last\\nupdate to find out which project has the newer version of the data item.\\nOnce Petrel has determined the matches, all data in the projects will be marked with one of the\\nfollowing icons:\\n- Indicates that a counterpart was not found in the other project (might be intended to be\\nthe same data, but the objects have different GUIDs)\\n- Indicates that the counterpart is the same (has the same time stamp)\\n- Indicates that the data item is newer\\n- Indicates that the counterpart is newer\\n- Indicates that at least one data item\\'s time stamp status differs from this node\\'s\\nFor wells, you can specify other match criteria, besides having them match based on the\\nGUID. See the section titled \"Well Matching in the Reference project tool\" for more information.\\nNote that the following steps will create an object with a new GUID:\\n1. Create an object via a process (such as the make/edit surface process which creates a new\\nsurface)\\n2. Copy and paste an object in the Petrel Explorer tree\\n3. Import an object via File> Import using an ASCII file or via the OpenSpirit transfer method\\n4. Use the copy mode in the Reference project tool\\nThe following steps will create an object without a new GUID:\\n1. Import an object via the Reference project tool (copy mode toggled off)\\n2. Copy and save the entire project using the File > Save As option or copying the entire\\nproject using Windows based tools.\\nSpecial Considerations for some objects\\nSome objects will always match in the Reference project tool. These objects are\\nWells main folder and all the Vintage folder Flow constraint IDs under Input\\nfixed sub-folders\\nLight source folder under Flow control folder under Input\\nDatums under Templates Windows\\nSymbolic time set folder under\\nVariables under Workflow Cursor tracking under Input'},\n",

For example, if you do not\\nwant to see data that is equal in the projects, you can click the filter option . This will remove\\nall the data from the tree that is equal to its counterpart.\\nThe Reference project tool allows you to filter out data in one or more of these groups:\\nClicking on one of the filter option\\'s icon will toggle that filter on and off. Filters for the working\\nproject and the background project are applied separately.\\nSometimes you see data items displayed in the tree with an exclamation mark on their\\nstatus icon whereas they should disappear according to the time stamp filter settings. The reason\\nis that these data items have children which still fulfill the filter criteria and they cannot be\\nvisualized without their parents. If the filter symbols do not seem to reflect the actual situation,\\nopen up the sub-folders to view the child nodes and see the correct filter symbols. You can\\nexpand and collapse the entire sub-tree by right-clicking on an object. For example, suppose a\\nparent Models node has an equal status and the Models sub-tree is collapsed, but one of its 3D\\ngrids has a newer status. Toggling off the equals filter will leave that Models node (and its equals\\nicon) showing, since one of its child nodes, the 3D grid, has a newer than status. You need to\\nopen up the sub-tree to find this item.\\nFiltering based on a shape, rectangle and saved search\\nAreal filtering allows you to filter data in a project based on a shape. A shape is any object that\\nhas a minimum/maximum X and a minimum/maximum Y value.\\nOnce you specify a shape, the bounding rectangle is \"drawn\" based on the minimum/maximum X\\nand minimum/maximum Y coordinates. The Reference project tool filters the trees based on the\\nsmallest rectangle that defines that object.\\nThe filter creates a rectangle still based on the minimum/maximum X and minimum/maximum Y\\ncoordinates, but is now including some regions that are not technically within the shape itself.\\nIn the figure below, refer to wells A, B, and C. A bounding rectangle is created around the\\nspecified shape. Well A is included, as expected. Well C is ignored, also as expected. However,\\nwell B is included in the filtered data because it is inside the bounding rectangle, even though it is\\nnot within the shape.\\nData without geographical information will always be visible, regardless of the filter settings.\\nTo specify the filter criteria, follow this procedure:\\nClick on the filter icon above the project that you want to filter.\\nThere are several different options you can choose for your filter. You can combine the spatial\\nfilter criteria and criteria from a saved search within the project, or apply them separately. These\\nare the various options you can use to set the filter criteria:\\n- Select Spatial filter for wells and geographical data as shown below.\\n- To enter a shape from your project, select it in the Petrel Explorer pane and click the blue arrow\\nnext to the Petrel shape field. Notice that the minimum and maximum values for X and Y are\\nautomatically populated in the Extents section. You can only add an object from the project you\\nare filtering.\\nThe minimum and maximum X and Y values are based on the object you select.\\nAlternatively, you can manually set the X and Y values without selecting an object, or after\\nselecting an object.\\n- If you want to manually adjust the minimum and maximum settings, click Extents to make the\\nfields editable.\\n- Click Include objects that are partially within the range to keep objects that do not fall\\ncompletely within the specified range, but are included.\\nFilters accept saved searches only from the current project where you are creating the filter\\n(working to working and background to background). You can apply a saved search that is\\ncurrently in the project to act as an additional filter. Click Additional filter for wells only , then\\nspecify a search in the Saved searches drop-down menu.\\nShapes are handled differently. If you are setting a filter in the background project, you can\\nselect a shape from the working project.\\nOnce you have specified all of the filter criteria, click OK to close the window. The active filter is\\nindicated in the Reference project tool as shown below. You can reopen the filter window at any\\ntime to change the criteria for the filter.\\nWhen you filter wells, well top information is also filtered.\\nIn this example, the user has chosen to display only the wells in the project beginning with \"C\"\\ninside the specified shape. The information shown in the Well Tops folder relates only to those\\nwells.\\nTo turn off the filter, click the filter icon again, clear all the settings, and click OK .\\nRefreshing the data trees\\nYou can refresh the list for both projects by clicking Refresh which is located in the upper right\\ncorner of both project panes. The working project is refreshed based on the latest transfers, or\\nany changes you have made outside of the Reference project tool (directly in the Petrel tree).\\nClicking Refresh on the background project side will update the background project according to\\nthe last transfers and transfers that other users have made.\\nUsing projects from previous Petrel versions\\nPetrel projects saved in version 2007 and newer can be used as reference projects with no issues.\\nSome restrictions apply to the use of projects created with versions of Petrel prior to 2007:\\n1. You can use these projects as read-only background projects. You can transfer data from\\nthe project; you just cannot transfer data to the project.\\n2. Seismic data in these projects is not visible in the Reference project tool. As a workaround\\nto see the seismic, save the project in the Petrel 2007 or newer format, and re-open it as a\\nbackground project.\\n3. Comparison information should be ignored because the way in which comparisons were\\nmade in previous versions of Petrel is different than how they are made in Petrel versions\\n2007 and newer.\\nUnits and coordinate system considerations\\nThe Reference project tool is units and coordinates aware. Projections and units within the two\\nprojects must match for the Reference project tool to fully enable transfers. Some exceptions apply:\\n1. If the units and coordinates do not match, you can still transfer workflows and windows, as\\nthese objects do not have a coordinate systems or units impact. When it comes to Petrel Spatial\\nproject (read more under Spatial enablement) ,\\nthe Reference project tool will support coordinate conversion of supported data items. This\\nopens the door for companies to minimize data duplication by creating a set of a spatial aware\\nmaster project where the user transfers data into their working project in a different coordinate\\nsystem. When there is a coordinate system mismatch between the working project and the\\nbackground project, the Reference project tool\\'s data trees are filtered so the user can only\\ntransfer and coordinate convert supported data. When there is a coordinate system mismatch, a\\nwarning will appear to warn the user that only spatially supported data items will displayed in\\nthe Reference project tool.\\n2. Keep in mind that template units must match to be able to transfer templates by the use of the\\nReference project tool. The Reference project tool will check unit consistency between the\\ntemplates in the working project and the background project, especially all predefined templates\\nand user-defined templates with matching GUIDs. The usage of, for example, Caliper template\\nunits must be consistent throughout the communicating projects and not altered after imported.\\nIf there are any mismatches between template units, there will be a dialog displayed listing the\\nmismatched pairs.\\n3. If the background project does not have a coordinate system value, data can still be copied, but\\nthe Reference project tool will warn you about it.\\nPetrel will assist you in ensuring that units and coordinates are matched, under limited circumstances:\\nIf the working project is empty or the working project\\'s coordinate system and/or unit is not set, the\\nbackground project\\'s unit and coordinate system values can be copied from the background project.\\nAdvanced alteration allowing transfer of mismatched template units\\nThere is a possibility to alter the petrel.exe.config file to allow transfers of mismatched template units\\nto be done with the Reference project tool. This is only recommended to be used when the user\\nunderstands the impact it will have on the asset team\\'s reference project network data flow. To enable\\nthe transfer simply open the petrel.exe.config file and add the following flag:\\n<add key=\"allowRPTCopyWithTemplateUnitsMismatch\" value=\"On\"/>\\nAdvanced alteration allowing selection of variants of ft\\nThe petrel.exe.config can be extended to allow variants of ft, which are used in some OpenWorks and\\nGeoFrame coordinate systems. To enable this, add this following section to the config file:\\n<appSettings>\\n<add key=\"enableFtSearsAsLengthUnit\" value=\"On\"/>\\n<add key=\"enableFtUSasLengthUnit\" value=\"On\"/>\\n</appSettings>\\nOnce enabled, users can choose ftUS and ftSears as variants. Petrel does not store these units as\\nproject units, but as standard ft and a modifier flag.\\nThe Reference project tool must ensure that not only the units are the same, but also the modifiers,\\nwhich are stored as booleans in the ProjectStyle and ProjectUnitsStyle. These flags are accessible via\\nProjectStyle by:\\nbool getUnitXYisUSFeet() const;\\nbool getUnitZisUSFeet() const;\\nbool getUnitXYisSearsFeet() const;\\nbool getUnitZisSearsFeet() const;\\nWhen copying data into an empty project the flags need to be copied as well using the ReasonId\\nsetUnitXYisUSFeet(bool in);\\nReasonId setUnitZisUSFeet(bool in);\\nReasonId setUnitXYisSearsFeet(bool in);\\nReasonId setUnitZisSearsFeet(bool in);\\nUnit conversions Petrel 2010.1\\nIssues related to import/ export are altered because the Ocean unit service uses more accurate\\nconversion factors. In general, Petrel 2010.1 honors the \"number of decimals\" set in templates for\\nmore values than previously.\\nSome inconsistencies in scaling factors used for unit conversions in Petrel 2009.2 are now corrected\\nautomatically in Petrel 2010.1:\\ng/cm (grammes per centimetre): conversion to/from SI\\n2009.2: g/cm = 100 kg/m\\n2010.1: g/cm = 0.1 kg/m\\ng/m (grammes per metre): conversion to/from SI\\n2009.2: g/m = 1 kg/m\\n2010.1: g/m = 0.001 kg/m\\nBtu/(s.degF.ft) (Btu per sec per Fahrenheit per foot): conversion to/from SI\\n2009.2: Btu/(s.degF.ft) = 2080.0411 W/(m.K)\\n2010.1: Btu/(s.degF.ft) = 6230.64479893701 W/(m.K)\\nh/cm3 (oil non Darcy D factor): conversion to/from SI\\n2009.2: h/cm3 = 3.5999E10 s/m3\\n2010.1: h/cm3 = 3.6E9 s/m3\\n(cP.cm3)/(h.atm) (cp cubic centimetre /hour /atm): conversion to/from SI\\n2009.2: (cP.cm3)/(h.atm) = 1.14227E-19 m3\\n2010.1: (cP.cm3)/(h.atm) = 2.74145351865559E-18 m3\\nMolar masses (in the \"mol\" unit) are now displayed in the correct SI\\nPetrel 2009.2: 1 mol = meaning 1 kg-mole\\nPetrel 2010.1: 1000 mol =meaning 1000 gm-mole\\nData specific considerations\\nChanges to object properties such as attributes (for wells and horizons) must be handled in a\\nsequential manner. These cannot be edited simultaneously by two different users in two different\\nprojects and sent back to a reference project. (If this is done, the work done by the first user will\\nbe lost). In this case, the users must work sequentially. This limitation does not apply to well tops\\nwhere individual well tops can be updated independently.

To remove a project from the list, select the one you want to remove,\\nclick Load and locate a project which is already on the list but different from the one you want to\\nremove.\\nWell Matching in the Reference project tool\\nThe Well matching feature in the Reference project tool allows you to declare a different\\nmatching criterion for wells, rather than just matching based on the GUID. A common situation\\nwhen trying to match data from different projects, is to have a number of wells that you know are\\nidentical, but have been loaded into each project separately, such as via an ASCII load, thereby\\ngetting two separate GUIDs. They are the same well, but since they have separate GUIDs, the\\nReference project tool treats them as unmatched. One key point about Petrel is that data\\nitems are related and linked to each other. By using the Well matching feature, you are\\nspecifying that the wells are the same based on criteria such as UWI or surface location. Once you\\ndeclare the wells are a match and transfer data dependent on the wells (such as logs), the\\nReference project tool will keep links between the dependent data and the wells intact.\\nOnce you declare the matches, the newly matching wells will appear as matched in the\\nReference project tool. These matched entities can be moved from one project to another as if\\nthey were matched by GUID.\\nExisting GUID matches will not be affected by the Well matching tool, it will only match\\nwells that could not be matched base on their GUIDs\\nMatches are not remembered; the intention is to declare the match, and then synchronize\\nthe wells and dependent data such as logs and well tops so that in the future, there is not data\\ndisparity. If you close the Reference project tool, the matches must be declared again\\nSpecifying well matches\\nNotice that in the Reference project tool below, there are several unmatched wells. These wells\\nare shown with the purple unmatched icon .\\nTo declare these wells as matches, click the Well matching button. The Well\\nmatching dialog opens:\\nYou can declare matches based on specific criteria (Advanced mode) or by manually selecting a\\nwell from each side and declaring it a match (Manual mode).\\nHow to match wells in Advanced Mode\\nYou can match wells based on the following criteria:\\n- Well name: matches if the well names are identical\\n- Unique well identifier: matches if the Unique Well Identifiers (UWIs) are identical\\n- Surface location, Bottom hole location: matches if the tolerance between the two well\\nheads or two bottom hole positions is less than that specified\\n- KB Elevation: matches if the vertical difference of KB elevations is less than the tolerance\\nspecified\\n- Total depth: matches if the difference in total length of the well, from first point to last point, is\\nless than the tolerance specified\\n- Number of points in well trace: matches if there are less unequal points in the well trace\\nthan the tolerance specified\\nUnits shown are derived from the units set for the project.\\nSelect one or more of the match criteria, and click Apply. Note that only those wells that meet all\\nof the selected match criteria are considered matches.\\nFor example, the criteria below declares wells to be the same if they have the same name, are\\nwithin 10m on the surface, and KB is within 5m:\\nIn our example, clicking Apply results in the following matches, which are shown in the Match\\nreport:\\nThe Match report allows you to verify that the match criteria you specified was correct.\\nTo have a record of the matched wells, click Export. A comma-separated values (.csv) file is\\nproduced for the matched wells. The report shows the criteria you specified and also includes the\\nGUIDs for the wells.\\nEach match has a check mark next to it. Select which matches you would like to approve, and\\nclick OK. The approved matches are populated back into the main Well matching dialog in the\\nbottom pane, as shown below:\\nWhen there are multiple matches for a given well, the tool picks the first available match. In\\nmost cases, you can eliminate multiple matches by using more criteria or lower tolerances.\\nTo undo a match from those shown in the bottom pane, select the match, and return it back to\\nthe unmatched group, by clicking the blue up arrow.\\nHow to match wells in Manual Mode\\nAnother method for declaring matched wells is by manually selecting a well from each side. You\\ncan do this by clicking the Manual tab in the Well matching dialog:\\nAll unmatched wells in each project are shown within their tree. You can declare two wells to be a\\nmatch by selecting them in both lists and clicking the blue down arrow. The matched wells are\\nthen moved to the bottom pane. For example, in the above dialog, wells A10 are being declared\\nas a match.\\nYou can undo a match by selecting the wells (A15 shown selected above) and returning it back to\\nthe unmatched group, by clicking the blue up arrow.\\nTo export the unmatched wells information to a CSV file, which can be viewed in Microsoft Excel,\\nclick Export. The report shows the criteria you specified, and also includes the GUIDs for the\\nwells.\\nThe Export feature works even when a background project is not loaded. This allows you to\\nexport information on all the wells in the project for any data management purpose. This is only\\napplicable to the Export button on the Manual tab (not the export option in the Match report\\ndialog).\\nThe well matcher will work even if there are units or coordinates mismatch. However, the\\nstandard limitations on the Reference project tool will prevent data transfers if the units or\\ncoordinates are mismatched.\\nViewing the results of the matched wells in the\\nReference project tool\\nOnce you have all intended matches in the bottom pane of the Well matching dialog, click Close\\n. The wells you have matched are then compared by the Reference project tool and the time\\nstamp status is updated, as shown in the below dialog with wells A15 (the only one that was\\nselected not to be matched):\\nAt this point, you can transfer data between the matched wells with all of their child data\\nrelationships (such as models) remaining intact.\\nKnown limitations of the Reference project tool\\nInaccuracies in time stamps\\nThe Reference project tool works by comparing internal data time stamps. This time stamp is\\ncurrently visible in only one place: the Reference project tool, when you select data and view the\\nDetails time stamp information. There are some inconsistencies around when a data item is\\nconsidered to be updated. For example, changing the well tops values for TWT picked will not\\naffect the time stamp for the TWT picked attribute. Other changes to the attribute itself will\\nchange the time stamp. In another case, changes to the values of well tops values will not only\\nmark the well tops as changed, but will also mark the well filters and horizon as changed. The\\nreason for this is that currently the only way to copy well tops are through their related well filter\\nor horizon.\\nWhen upgrading projects from Petrel version 2005 to 2007 or newer, the time stamps for all data\\nis set to the time of upgrading. The reason for this is that the time stamp was introduced in Petrel\\n2007. The only place it is possible to see the time stamp used by the Reference project tool is by\\nselecting the object data item and looking at its Detail information.\\nSometimes, there is no correlation between the time stamp for the last history of an item (as\\nseen in the Properties dialog) for a well and the time stamp used by the Reference project tool.\\nThis is because the well can be updated by well-related objects like well tops and logs, but Petrel\\ndoes not consider this to be a change to the well itself. For example, if you change the time log\\nfor a well, the time stamp in the Reference project tool for the well is updated. However, the time\\nstamp for the history of the well in the Properties dialog is not updated.\\nData not showing as equal after being transferred\\nWhen transferring data, in some cases the transferred data appears to be newer than the original.\\nThis is caused by the fact that the transferred version is actually modified after being inserted in\\nthe working project.\\nAn example of this is when transferring well top\\'s well filters. If the original well filter is linked to a\\nwell and the well does not exist in the working project, the transferred well filter will be unlinked\\nin the working project. This operation will update the time stamp for the well filter.\\nAnother example is when transferring wells with a time log. The wells folder (and not the\\nindividual well) defines how the time logs are calculated (such as depending on the well tops). In\\nthis case, as soon as well tops appear for the well, the time log is always recalculated. When the\\ntime log is recalculated, the time stamp for the well and the well log is updated. In addition, when\\nthe time log is explicitly changed, the well is changed when viewed in the time domain. This\\nconfuses some users who expect the transferred well to be equal, but more likely; the transferred\\nwell will be tagged as new.\\nErroneous visualization states\\nIn some cases, the visualization state for data is not transferred correctly. As a general solution,\\ntry one of the following: Copy the window one more time or set the visualization state manually.\\nThe erroneous visualization states are related to the following:\\n- The Results tree where the visualization information is not copied at all. In this case the only\\nsolution is to manually set the visualization state\\n- Well section tracks where the order of the tracks will be changed. In this case, the well section\\nmust be transferred from the background project to restore the order.\\nStyles not transferring correctly\\nThe information in the Styles pages is transferred along with the data. This transfer does not\\nalways produce the correct result.\\nOne such example is a grid property where isosurfaces are defined. If this property is transferred\\nusing the Reference project tool, the isosurfaces will not be visible in the working project.'},\n",

The data can be upscaled into the active grid (use the treat data as\\npoints option). Points cannot be filtered, no spreadsheet display for all attributes, no\\nstereonet display, limited display of dip and strike data in 2D and 3D. It is\\nrecommended for core data.\\nPoint well data can also be imported into the Wells folder. They can be displayed as\\ndiscs, strike bars or dip sticks in 3D, and dip arrows or pie charts in a map window.\\nPoints can also be displayed in a stereonet and filtered on any text attributes they\\nhave.

The Well header (as well heads (*.*) format) : A well head ASCII file must be created to\\nspecify the top position of the well path, the well name and optionally a well symbol.\\nIn the import dialog for well header, insert as many attributes columns as required. Attributes can\\nbe of several types, including string, continuous, discrete and date.\\n2. The Deviation survey (as well path/deviation (ASCII) (*.*) format) : If the well is not\\nvertical, an ASCII file containing the deviation survey must be imported describing its path. In the\\nimport dialog for the well/path deviation, specify the attributes being used from the survey (MD,\\nInclination, Azimuth here). It is also important to set the appropriate MD and TVD elevation\\nreference.\\n3. The Well logs (as Well logs (LAS) (*.las) files) : Are attached to the existing well path. Specify\\nthe logs to be loaded to have better control over them, and attach them to an already existing\\nPetrel template.\\nNote: The Reference Project tool can also be used to copy wells, logs and well tops between\\nprojects. Petrel Reference Project tool supports user-defined matching of wells with different\\nGUIDs.\\nThe LAS 3.0 loader has been replaced with a general loader that supports LAS 1.2, 2.0 and 3.0.\\nThis offers several improvements over Petrel s existing LAS import capability:\\nLoading errors and warnings are now written to the message log. This means that batches\\nof files can be imported without user intervention.\\nThe loader is able to match files to wells using information in the LAS file header\\nThe loader will help ensure that logs and global logs have unique names.\\nThe loader now includes a file preview area so that the header and first line of data can be\\nQC ed before import.\\nWells Logs in DLIS format\\nPetrel supports importing well log data in DLIS format. Data recorded in DLIS (Digital Log\\nInterchange Standard) format is using an \"object-oriented\" technology. It provides a powerful\\nmechanism for recording frame data. Static and transient information by means of uniform syntax\\nand an \"object-oriented approach\". DLIS supports the definition of an object described in terms of\\nattributes and can be organized in sets. This is a general technique of representing new\\ninformation. A range of information items can be represented under the DLIS and be extended\\nindefinitely.\\nHow to import DLIS files\\n1. Right-click on the Wells folder and select Import (on selection) .\\n2.

The well manager also\\nprovides a convenient way to add new wells to the project.\\nWhen a well position is shifted using the well manager fields, or directly at the local well level, all\\nthe well information attached can be linked to the trace.\\nFor example: if an x location was initially entered erroneously, the user can insert a new\\nposition; well tops, checkshots and any other trace data can be shifted along with the new\\nposition on MD. This is an improvement on previous releases, where only edits on Kelly Bushing\\nwere linked.\\nFor more detail information about Well Manager tool see Well manager after import.'},\n",

In Petrel 2005,\\nit was sort of assumed that the user would pick horizon A in all wells and then move to picking\\nhorizon B in all wells, where as in reality a geologist is more likely to want to pick all tops in Well 1\\nand then move on to picking all tops in Well 2. Using the shorcuts in the keyboard, you will reduce\\nthe amount of mouse movement required when correlating well tops.\\nHow to change the position of an already existing well top surface\\n1. Make the well section active.\\n2. Click on the Create/Edit Well Tops icon in the function bar.\\n3. Make sure the well top surfaces are visible in the Well Section window.\\n4. Move one of the well top surfaces by dragging the correlation line within one of the\\ndisplayed wells.\\nTo place a well top surface at a specified depth, simply right-click on the well top in the Well\\nSection window and type in the depth in the depth display that opens up.\\nPop-up dialog for specifying accurate depth of a well top surface.\\nLocking well tops\\nLocking well tops ensures they are not accidentally moved during editing. This can happen if the\\nuser accidentally clicks on a well top and moves it, but also if the well top being edited is moved\\nonto another well top such that the two become collapsed and are then moved together.\\nIf the user attempts to edit a well top, or a group of collapsed well tops in which one is locked,\\nthen the message At least one of the selected well tops are locked will appear.\\nThere are two methods for locking well tops:\\nLocking hidden well tops - As a default, well tops that are not displayed will be locked.\\nThis is a setting on the well tops settings panel.\\nLocking specific horizons - Specific horizons within the well tops can be locked by either\\nright-clicking on the horizon in the Stratigraphy folder under the Well Tops and choosing\\nLock well top, or by double clicking the horizon and locking the well top on the horizons\\nsettings page.\\nAs mentioned before, Locking the well tops will prevent accidental movement on the Well\\nSection window. However, the well top can still be moved to a different position using alternative\\nmethods.\\nAs an example, you can reposition a locked well top by right clicking the well top in the well\\nsection window and writing in a new depth in the pop up box. The well top will then be moved\\nto the new position even if it is locked!. In addition, the spreadsheet can also be used to\\nassign a new position to a locked well top. Finally, by using the undo or redo buttons, the\\nlocked well top will be repositioned as well.\\nWorking with the Zone log\\nTo generate a zone log in a well tops folder, right-click on the well tops and choose\\nInsert/Update Zone Log. The log will then be located in Global well logs and can be\\ndisplayed in the well section window. It will automatically be updated with any edits to well tops,\\nnew horizons, etc.\\nPetrel will automatically attempt to fill in the correct zones between well tops, however in certain\\nsituations, particularly where faults exist or if well tops are deleted, it may not be successful. In\\nthis case use the flood fill tool to change the zone, see Creating and editing discrete log\\ncurves.\\nEditing well top time\\nOnce a time depth relationship has been established, pressing Show Well Top Time will\\ndisplay the well tops in time in the well section window at the same time as they are displayed in\\ndepth. The time top will be displayed with a dotted line and will be connected to the depth top\\nlevel. If the time at the top has not been previously edited or inputted manually, then it will be\\ninitially in the same place as the depth top.\\nToggle on Edit Well Top Time to edit the time top when it is displayed.\\nCreate / Edit well tops must be active before these tools are available.\\nEditing well tops in 3D\\nTo edit the well tops in 3D, the Make/Edit well tops process must be active. The editing\\nfunctionality is similar in principle to that of the Key Pillars with the widget moving in a similar\\npattern, although the user cannot leave the well path (assuming that the well top is linked to the\\nwell path). Picking the tangent turns this yellow and you can pull the widget along the tangent\\nline. If Well Tops are close, you can pick the plane (turns yellow) and by pulling it out first, you\\ncan now do the cylinder (tangent) editing outside the path while the well top actually moves along\\nthe path.\\nWell tops displayed in 3D\\nHow to edit well tops in 3D\\n1. Display the wells and well tops you wish to work with.\\n2. Activate the Make/Edit Well Tops process step in the Process diagram. A new set of\\nicons will be displayed in the Function bar.\\n3. Click on the well top to be edited; it turns into a widget with a cylinder and a plane.\\n4. Click and press the left mouse button on the cylinder of the white widget. Drag the well top\\nalong the well trajectory to where you want it.\\nTo display depth values, rather than stratigraphic names on the well tops, open the Well Tops\\nfolder and change by toggling on Z in the Attributes folder.'},\n",

Activate and visualize a Well section window containing wells being displayed.\\n2. Click on the header of any of the wells (colored area at the top of the well with the well\\nname) and drag it to one side, the ghost curve will now appear in the window.

This can be changed by opening the settings for the ghost curve, style tab,\\nand under Height you can select a different Fraction of window to be displayed.\\nScaling and scrolling in the ghost curve\\nBy default, the ghost curve is given an additional depth track panel for making scrolling and\\nscaling easier. If you need to remove it, go to the ghost curve in the Windows pane, and toggle\\noff the depth track panel from here (or simply delete it).\\nTo change the scale on the ghost curve, select the ghost curve and then use + and - to change\\nthe scale. Using Shift together with these buttons will allow you to make finer adjustments to the\\nscaling. Alternatively, position the cursor on the line between the grey and white area in the depth\\ntrack panel of the ghost curve. When the cursor becomes a double arrow, move it to stretch or\\nsqueeze the well. Use arrow up and arrow down to scroll (with Shift for incremental scrolling). You\\ncan also scroll by positioning the cursor on the white depth panel, and move the hand icon while\\nusing the left mouse button to scroll the display up or down the well.\\nThe ghost curve can be set to use either its own scale or the scale of the underlying well\\nsection. By default the ghost curve does not scale in synch with the background well section\\nwindow, in this way you can more easily fix the scale of the ghost curve independent of the scale\\nof the well section. This should help the user in cases where the log signatures are similar, but\\nstratigraphic thicknesses are different between wells. This behavior can be overridden by\\ndeselecting the Specify depth scale option in the settings for the ghost curve.\\nBy using the Toggle synchronized well scaling icon , you can scale the ghost curve in synch with\\nthe well section.\\nNote: The ghost curve does not scroll or flatten in synch with the background well section,\\nand this cannot be overridden.\\nSettings for the Ghost curve\\nDouble-click on the ghost curve icon, under the well section folder in the Windows pane, to open\\nthe settings panel. The Info tab contains the name of the ghost and a comment field. The Style\\ntab has the following settings:\\nHeight- Set the fraction of the window height to be displayed (%).\\nBackground- Set the background color of the ghost curve and transparency.\\nCurves- Select whether or not to display curve fill (the underlying well must have curve\\nfill).\\nDynamic adaptation- This setting controls how the curve behaves as it is dragged across\\nother wells in the well section. There are three options:\\nNone - The curve will no longer change depending on the underlying well. Logs can\\nbe turned on and off under the ghost curve on the Windows pane. If this option is\\nused, it is wise to first change to underlying well so that all the log panels are\\navailable in the windows panel.\\nUnderlying curve (default) - As the ghost curve is dragged across the section, it\\nwill change according to the log panel it is being dragged over. The ghost will look for\\nthe equivalent panel in the well where the ghost is applied and display that data in the\\nstyle of the underlying well.\\nUnderlying well - As the ghost curve is dragged across the section, it will change\\naccording to the well panel it is being dragged over. The ghost will display data from\\nthe well where the ghost is applied in the style of the underlying well; all of the well\\npanels will be displayed.\\nThe Settings tab allows you to select the Depth measurement type to be displayed\\n(SSTVD, TVD, MD, TWT, etc), to specify the Depth range to use, and also has the option of\\nSpecifying a fixed depth scale if required.\\nNote: In previous version of Petrel it was possible to pick well tops in the ghost curve\\nby clicking on the ghost curve directly, then the well tops were placed on the wellbore from\\nwhich the ghost curve was created originally. This functionality has been removed. Now, if\\nyou place the ghost curve over a well, and then pick well tops, the tops will be assigned to\\nthe underlying well. You can click inside the ghost, but the well top will be placed on the\\nbackground well. This should help you to match the patterns more intuitively.\\nSelecting a template\\nThe adoption of a template does away with the tree of visuals on which the user previously had to\\ngroup and ungroup curves, define color fills, and so on. Rather than having to create and apply\\nthe template in separate work steps, you can now work directly on the template, seeing\\ninteractively edited curve fills and track widths updated instantaneously across the entire well\\nsection window.\\nWhen you open a new Well section window, you will have to select the well section template you\\nwish to use.

This can be replaced with a single template that\\nincludes all candidates for the non-unique measurement type\\nUsing different Well section templates in a\\nsingle well section window\\nIt is possible to use different Well section templates for different wells in the same Well section\\nwindow. Do the following:\\n1. Select the well in the Definition tab under the Settings for the Well section window (1)\\n2. Deselect the Use default check box (2).\\n3. Select a different template from the Template drop-down list (3)\\n4. Click Apply to visualize the changes in the Well section window.\\n5. You can still edit data styles on the Template settings dialog, that can be accessed using\\nthe shortkey next to the drop-down list.\\nChoose from a set of default well section\\ntemplates\\nThe separation of the template settings from project data also enables us to equip Petrel 2010.1\\nwith a set of default templates. These have been based on standard templates, with some Petrel-\\nspecific additions.\\nThe templates are encoded in a Petrel xml schema and installed in the program files directory on\\nyour computer. Because the list of candidate data in the definition is part of the schema, two\\ntypes of templates are supported:\\n1. “Naked” templates, in which the curve is only defined by a property template and there are\\nno candidates. These templates will be populated automatically with any project data that\\nmatches the property template.\\n2. Templates in which a log curve preference system has been defined for each curve in the\\ntemplate. These templates will also be populated automatically with project data, but only\\nthose data with matching property template and name.\\nTriple combo\\nThis combination of curves and scales is one of the most common standards in the logging\\nindustry. The curve colors used in the Petrel template are consistent with other petrophysics\\napplications. As with other Petrel default templates, the definition is left open. In this case\\n(Gullfaks) you can see that 2 candidates have been found for the Gamma ray. You can also see\\nthat SP is defined in the template, but no data has been found.\\nResistivity sonic\\nThis combination of curves and scales is another logging industry standard. The curve colors used\\nin the Petrel template are consistent with other petrophysics applications. Like other Petrel default\\ntemplates, the definition is left open. As with the Triple combo template the Resistivity curves are\\ndefined using specific templates for the 3 depths of investigation. This could be loosened if non-\\nspecific resistivity curves are to be used.\\nDensity neutron shaded\\nIt is customary to shade between the density and neutron curves to highlight crossover and aid\\nlithology interpretation . This template includes fills in standard colors.\\nComposite log\\nThis template is designed to show the type of information typically shown on a composite well log\\n(or completion log).

Available scales are :\\nMD- Measured depth\\nTVD- True vertical depth\\nSSTVD- Sub sea true vertical depth\\nOWT -One way time, requires a time relationship\\nTWT -Two way time, requires a time relationship\\nTVT -True vertical thickness, requires stratigraphic dip and azimuth data\\nTST -True stratigraphic thickness, requires stratigraphic dip and azimuth data\\nThis will change which scale is displayed linearly down the well section view, and should not be\\nconfused with the depth scales which are displayed next to the well section (which need not be\\nlinear). If a scale requires additional data (OWT, TWT, TVT, TST) and this data is not available,\\nthen it will not appear in the list.\\nGeneral track settings\\nWhen a log curve is added to the Well section, it will get a track folder and a corresponding log\\npanel. The track panel's Style tab controls the settings for the scaling, grid line colors, whether\\nthese should be displayed (vertical and horizontal), and background color and transparency for\\nthe panel.

To quickly fill a continuous curve with the colors from the color template, click on the\\nappropriate side of the curve using the Create/edit curve fills icon. The following options are\\navailable:\\nPressing SHIFT and clicking will truncate either the top MD or the base MD of the fill\\n(depending on which one is closer). Once truncated, more truncations can be added in MD\\nusing the SHIFT key and clicking in the empty field. Hold down the SHIFT key while\\ninserting the color fill.\\nPressing C with the mouse pointer over a fill, will toggle through the coloring of the fill by:\\nproperty, specified, black, and white.\\nPressing X will toggle the pattern fill on and off.\\nPressing SHIFT and X , will toggle through all of the available pattern fills.\\nPressing DELETE will remove the curve fill. If the mouse pointer is over the fill limit (top or\\nbase MD, curve truncations, etc.), it will be removed .\\n2 . More complex curve fills can be designed through the Curve filling tab under the Well\\nsection template settings . Remember to highlight the track you want to fill color in. There is\\nno limit to the number of curve fills that can be drawn on a single well log. To add a new curve fill,\\nclick the Append row icon. There are a few setting to specify for each curve filling:\\nDepth interval - Can be specified either by specifying a MD value or by selecting\\ntop/bottom of the well.\\nFill edge - The fill can be specified to and from: Panel edge , Curve and Level .\\nFill style - This is where you specify whether to use a pattern to fill the log curve or a\\ncolor. If you select color, choose between: Specified , As property , As grid property ,\\nBlack, and White .\\nColor fill for discrete curves\\nBy default, discrete curves will be filled and will not have any lines or points shown. The settings\\ncan be changed at the log level. Highlight the log under the track containing the discrete log and\\ngo to the Style tab. Select the 2D log sub-tab. There are additional options for discrete curves:\\nDiscrete value border ; show the border between facies.\\nFill with color ; fill the panel with the color of each facies.\\nFill with pattern ; fill the panel with the color of each facies.\\nShow value label ; post the name of each facies on each interval in the panel.\\nTo review the color settings of a discrete well log, open the Settings for the template directly in\\nthe Templates pane. Alternatively, open the Settings for the log under the Global well logs\\nfolder in the Input pane and go to the Colors tab.\\nDisplay of grid lines\\nThe settings for the display of gridlines are on the Style tab under the Well section template\\nsettings. There are separate settings for vertical and horizontal lines. The vertical lines can be\\neither Logarithmic or Linear . If linear is chosen, there are 3 options:\\nAuto - Petrel picks the amount of lines according to scale of data.\\nDivisions - You can assign a fixed amount of lines irrespective of log data range (limited to\\n1,2,3,4,5,10).\\nIncrement - You can specify increments of the data, the options depend on the max and\\nmin value of the log data (if auto) or the scale set by the user.\\nRemenber to select the Draw vertical lines check box. The same applies for the horizontal lines.\\nBackground track color\\nThe settings for the background color of track can be found under the Style tab in the Well\\nsection template settings. Transparency can be given to the background color.\\nGeneral log settings\\nWhen a log curve is added to the Well section, it will get a log panel stored under a track folder.\\nThe log panel Style tab controls the settings for the scaling of the curves, the position of the\\ncurve along the track (left or right), and the possibility of showing the log points. To access the\\nStyle tab open the Settings for the Well section template and go to the Well section\\ntemplate settings tab.\\nLog scales\\nTo set the curve scales appropiately, go to the General settings tab under the Style tab of the\\nWell section template settings for any continuous log. This will override the scale determined\\nby the colors tab of the attached template. The type of scale (linear or logarithmic) is a\\nparamenter of the track where the log is displayed. The default set is the maximum and minumin\\nvalues contained in the log. The scale can also be reversed here.\\nAdjust log curve scale\\nHow to adjust log curve scale\\nIt is important to understand how the log curve scale works when working with two curves or\\nmore with the same measurement type and same template (example GR and GR_30) in the same\\ntrack. When they are displayed in the same track, they share the log curve scale (i.e. they use\\nthe min and max value that apply to both). In other words, the log scale will look for the log\\nminimum value of all the curves with the same template and the maximum value of all the\\ncurves, and it will use this value for the log scale of the track panel.\\nIf you want to display two or more curves with the same measurement and same template, but\\ndifferent log scale, you can do it in two ways:\\n1. Display them in separate tracks, then each track will hold its own scale.\\n2. If you want them in the same track, but with different scale, there is a different approach:\\n- Create a new global template in the templates pane.\\n- It will be created at the bottom of the main templates folder it was created from. Open the\\nsettings of the new template, go to the Info tab, rename the template (for instance 'My gamma\\nray'), in the Measurement choose the one you need (for example for Gamma Ray select\\n'APIGammaRay'). Click OK.\\n- Next, go to the curve (under Global well logs folder) you want to display, open the settings and\\nin the Info tab, select the new Template you just created (My gamma ray). Click OK.\\n- Now each curve will act independently, you can set the log curve scale different for each of the\\ncurves.\\nTwo logs of same measurement type, with different scales, GR from 0-150 and GR_20 from 0-\\n100.\\nShowing the log points\\nThe measurement data will be shown as points along the log. To show the points, go to the 2D\\nlog tab under the Style tab of the Well section template settings for any continuous log.\\nChoose the color, symbol, and point size to be drawn along the log curve.\\nWell section layout\\nThe layout for the well section window can be controlled from the Layout tab under the Settings\\nfor any Well section window. From there you can control:\\n1. Horizontal spacing - controlling the space between wells in the Well section window.\\n2. Panel splitting - splits panels to avoid data overlap for faults, repeated stratigraphy or\\nhorizontal wells.\\nHorizontal spacing\\nHorizontal spacing determines the space between the wells in the well section. There are three\\noptions:\\n1. Manual - grab the left hand side of any of the well panels and drag the panel manually.\\nIrrespective of the method used for spacing the panels, you can do this once the settings\\npanel has been closed.\\n2. Constant - specifiy a constant distance in mm that should be used between each panel.\\n3. Relative - specifiy a well top on which to base the panel spacing and a horizontal scale.\\nThe distance between the wells will be scaled to the distance between the well tops.\\nPanel splitting\\nSplitting essentially takes a copy of the well panel and displays it to the side of the original panel.\\nThis is used when the well is inverted in the displayed depth scale, i.e. in a horizontal well when\\nTVD starts decreasing with increasing MD, or with reverse faults displayed in a TVT or TST scale\\nwhen stratigraphically equivalent sections have more than one value.\\nPanels can be splitt by:\\nGroup by intervals - arranges split panels so that identical intervals are put side by side.\\nGroup by data - arrange split panels so that panels from the same data object are side by\\nside.\\nCompact interval - will try to put intervals in existing split panels (from left to right) to\\nconserve screen space.\\nMin. interval length - will hide intervals smaller that the given length.\\nDisplay of other data in the Well section\\nwindow\\nData related to your 3D model as well as interpreted or imported data stored in the Input pane\\ncan be displayed across the whole Well section window. This data will be displayed as lines\\n(either continuous or dotted lines).\\nSurfaces, Horizons and Contacts\\nSurfaces, horizons, and contacts can all be displayed in the Well section window and appear in\\nmuch the same style as well tops.\\nThese data are displayed by selecting the appropriate object in the project explorer for viewing.\\nGo to the Input pane to select any generated or imported surface. To edit the style, open the\\nSettings for a particular surface.\\nGo to the Models pane to select any grid related structural horizon. To edit the style, open the\\nSettings of the horizons folder.\\nGo to the Models pane to select and contact.

The stratigraphy\\ncan then be visualized as a zone log in the Well section window.\\nHow to create a Zone Log\\n1. Right-click on the Well Tops folder and select Insert/update zone log. This creates the\\nfollowing items:\\nA discrete zone log stored at the bottom of the Global well Logs folder.\\nA new Discrete property template stored in the Templates pane.\\nA well attribute called Max Zone from 'Well Tops', stored under the Attributes folder in\\nWell Attributes. This gives the max number of zones in the well tops folder and cannot be\\nedited.\\n2. Open a Well Section window and display the Zone log linked to Well Tops from the Global\\nwell logs folder.\\nNote that the zone log is automatically updated for the well it belongs to. However, if a new\\nwell is inserted, it must be updated manually.\\nComment logs\\nComment logs can be used to insert annotation to particular sections of a well. These can be\\ncomments on particular features of a log; edits you have made or it can be imported ASCII files of\\ncore descriptions.\\nThe comment log is an independent log, associated with a well trace in much the same way as\\nany other well log. It is not explicitly associated with any particular log. Comments can relate to a\\npoint in the log or a zone in the log.\\nHow to create a comment log\\n1. Activate the Create/edit comments tool together with Create a new comments\\nlog from the Function bar.\\n2. Select the Comment log added in the Global well logs folder in the Input pane.\\nInteractively paint the comments box into a comments panel.\\n3. A single click in the comments panel will create a comment related to a point, while clicking\\nand dragging will assign the comment to an area. The comments settings window will open\\nwith a new comment inserted, enter the comment text and click Apply . Clicking on an\\nexisting comment will open it for editing.\\n4. Repeat the process until you have the desired number of comment boxes.\\nWhen you double-click in the comment box that you have just drawn in the Comment log , it will\\nopen the Settings for your Comment log . Define the text you want your log to have. You can\\nadd additional comment boxes in different depths.The background and text color can be specified\\nindividually; otherwise, the defaults on the style page will be used.\\nThe Comment log is stored in the Well section template settings as it is linked to the comment\\nlog defined in the Input pane on the Definition tab\\nThe comment log is displayed in a separate track in the Well section window.\\nBitmap logs\\nBitmaps of scanned logs, core photos, or any other relevant information can be imported and tied\\nto specific MD values along the well path for display purposes. Once imported, images can be\\nmoved and specific points on the bitmap can be tied to specific points on the well using control\\npoints. Between these points, Petrel will ensure that there are a constant number of pixels per\\nunit distance along the well in MD.\\nTo activate the editing of control points, you must activate Create/edit image control points\\n. The top and base of the image are control points by default, but can be moved. To add new\\ncontrol points, click on the bitmap log track at the desired point, then click on the new control\\npoint and drag it to the required MD value. The adjacent sections of the bitmap will be stretched\\nand squeezed respectively to accommodate the moved control point.\\nPress SHIFT while moving a control point to split the bitmap at that point. Dragging two bitmaps\\ntogether will join them.\\nTo import bitmaps onto a well path, right-click on the well and select Import (on\\nselection). Next, select one of the bitmap log formats, and import a bitmap file.\"},\n",

Petrel automatically creates a\\nwell section fence everytime you create a Well section window. The path of the plane follows\\nthe order of the chosen wells. To display a well section outline in a 2D-, Map-, or 3D- window,\\nselect the check box in front of the Well Section fence.\\nHow to create an Intersection Fence between wells\\nAn intersection fence is built up of vertical intersection planes drawn between the wells. The\\nalignment is made either from the top-, mid-, or base point of the well paths or from a well top.\\nIn addition to, for example, a top alignment, it is possible to tie the plane to the base of the well.\\nThe well fence is controlled from the Well Section in the Windows pane. The well fence can be\\ndisplayed in 3D-, Intersection- and Map view.\\n1. Insert a new well section from the Window menu. Select the wells of interest.\\nAlternatively, do this in 3D, with the Well correlation process active.\\n2. Once the wells are selected, double-click on the Well Section Fence under the active Well\\nSection in the Windows tab. This will take you to the Wells tab under the Settings for\\nthe fence.\\n3. Select to align fence to top, middle, bottom, or well top. Tie to point bottom if you have\\ndeviated or horizontal wells.\\n4. To close a fence (join the two ends), select the Close fence option.\\n5. Click OK.\\nTo change the visitation order, go to the Settings of the Well section window, and in the\\nDefinition tab select any well and move them up and down. The Well section fence visits the\\nwells in the order established here.\\nBy default, the wells in a new Well section fence are aligned at the bottom of the wells. Go to\\nthe Wells tab under the Settings for the Well section fence to align the wells at top, middle or\\nbottom - or on a Well top. The Well Top is inserted from the Well Tops stratigraphy folder. A\\nsecondary tie point at the well bottom can be added.\\nVertical well intersection\\nThe Vertical well intersection follows the well path. Once inserted it is fixed and cannot be moved.\\nHow to create a Vertical Wells Intersection from a\\nwell path\\nVertical intersections can be created along any well path imported or designed in Petrel. The\\nintersections can be created as a combined intersection for all wells or as separate ones for each\\nsingle well.\\n1. Right-click on the Wells folder (to make a combined intersection for all wells) or right-click\\non a single well (to make a single well intersection).\\n2. Select Create vertical well intersection from the menu.\\n3. An intersection along the well path(s) will be created and placed at the bottom of the Wells\\nfolder.\\nThe Extend start and Extend end for the plane can be set in the Style tab under the Settings\\nfor the vertical Well intersection. These will extend the plane by the specified amount beyond the\\nend of the well path in horizontal distance (in project units). If the end of the well is near vertical,\\nthis can result in extrapolation in an unexpected direction.\\nLog signatures\\nThis functionality is introduced in Petrel 2010.1. It enables efficient well data display in a map\\nwindow.\\nA Log signature is a small well section window which contains data from one well and is\\ndisplayed close to that well in the map view.\\nWell data displayed in log signature, as well as its style, is controlled by the selected well section\\ntemplate. To add a log signature you have to:\\n1. Make sure that you are displaying a Map window.\\n2. Open the Settings of the main Wells folder in the Input pane\\n3. Go to the Style tab and select the Log signatures sub-tab.\\n4. Add a new log signature (1). It will always have the name of the original forder as a suffix.\\nDifferent Log signatures should have different names.\\n5. Choose the Well section template you want to use from a drop-down list (2). The Well\\nsection template attached defines logs to be displayed and their style.\\n6. You can limit the wells to which the Log signature is applied to, by selecting Saved search\\nand selecting one from the list.\\n7. The position of the log signatures can be defined relative to the well path, top/base of\\ndisplayed depth interval or interactively adjusted in the Map window.\\n7.\\nIt is also possible to define a set of wells which will have log signatures attached and/or to define\\ndifferent signatures and quickly switch between them.\\nCombined well logs\\nIf you want to display data from more than one log at a time, there is an option to generate a\\ncombined log. It is possible to combine up to five logs into one and map the values to different\\nattributes of disks. The disks will be presented along the well trace in the 3D window, with an\\noption to display every nth disk (depends on re-sampling interval). The attributes are color, dip\\nangle, dip azimuth, size, and transparency.\\n1. Go to the Global well logs folder in the Input pane, right-click and select Insert global\\ncombined log. The Settings dialog for the combined log opens up.\\n2. Open the Operations tab.\\n3. Select Color; pick a log template to use as the color. The color log is mandatory.\\n4. Enter a Dip angle; pick the log that defines the dip angle (the dip angle is the gradient of\\nthe steepness of the disk). Only logs with appropriate values (0-90 degrees) should be used\\nas the dip angle.\\n5. Enter Dip azimuth; select the log that should define the dip azimuth (the dip azimuth is\\nthe direction of the disks dip). Only logs with appropriate values (0-360 degrees) should be\\nused for the dip azimuth.\\n6. Set Size; select the log that will define the maximal radius on the discs. The largest value\\nin the log represents the maximum radius and 0 (zero) is the smallest (minimum).\\n7. Select Transparency; pick a log template to set the transparency from. Transparency is\\n0% for the largest value in the log, and 100% for the smallest.\\n8. Select Resampling intervals from; Choose one of the logs, with the preferred interval, to\\nuse for the resampling procedure.\\nNote that a continuous log will normally create many disks due to the dense sampling\\ninterval; therefore, the filter for every nth disk should be used from the Style tab. On the\\ncontrary, discrete logs tend to create fewer disks.\\n9. Click the Update button and Apply or OK to generate the new combined log.\\nThe combined log is listed under the Global well logs folder. Select the check box in front of the\\ncombined log to visualize in a 3D window. The combined log will only be present where data from\\nall the logs used in the combined log occur.\\nPre Petrel 2010.1 well section windows\\nThe first time a project is opened in Petrel 2010.1, the well section windows will be scanned and\\nconverted to well section templates. This is what Petrel will do on project load:\\n1. Scan all well section windows and convert the tracks, data, and styles into a template\\n2. Merge templates that are identical\\n3. Organize the resulting templates into a folder for each window\\nOur priority was to preserve the way the Well section windows look ; greater subtlety\\nincreases the risk of losing valuable information. Therefore, the convertor works in a very literal\\nway: 2 well section wells are considered identical if:\\nThey have the same number of tracks, and\\nThe tracks have the same number of children, and\\nThe children are of the same type and have the same property templates, and\\nThe tracks and their children are in the same order and have the same style settings\\nIn spite of our best efforts, some features of existing windows may not be preserved, so you are\\nadvised to inspect the Well section templates created by Petrel. For example, data that was\\niconized on the Well section window tree and subsequently hidden, will be included and\\nvisualized.\\nThe chief downside of using a simple convertor is that we may create a large number of\\ntemplates. There are ways to rationalize these templates:\\nIf one well section template was applied to multiple windows, other copies may be deleted.\\nIf one well section template was applied to multiple windows, other copies may be deleted.\\nIf the well section window tree looks like the illustration below, Petrel will create more than\\none to reproduce the window. This can be replaced with a single template that includes all\\ncandidates for the non-unique measurement type.\\n1. In Petrel 2009.2, the 3 wells have different data visible.\\n2. Petrel recognizes that SGR is equivalent to GR so only 2 templates are needed to reproduce\\nthe window.\\n3. The definition of the Gamma ray curve includes both candidates. As long as GR is at the\\ntop, it can also be used for G16.\\n4. The wells are all set to use the same template. Once done, the spare template can be\\ndeleted.\\nSharing Well section templates between\\nprojects\\nBecause each object in the template can be referred to by using only a property template, the\\nWell section template can be exchanged between projects. Petrel will populate the template\\nwith data using the same mechanism as described above. There are two ways to exchange\\ntemplates:\\n1. Through the Reference project tool.\\n2. By exporting in xml format. Styles and candidates, if any, will be exported.\\nInteractive visualization\\nThis section covers the different ways to organize your well data without duplicating it. Several\\ntypes of search criteria and filters will allow you to visualize your well data.\\nSaved searches\\nA saved search functionality exists for well data, allowing users to display/access wells based on\\nspecified search criteria. The functionality is introduced to help organize well data into different\\nplace holders without duplicating data. The functionality is restricted to well data. Several types of\\nsearch criteria can be applied, and each search can be used in isolation or in combination with\\nother searches.'},\n",

Petrel avoids this by reading the parts necessary for visualization or processing directly\\nfrom the file, or by accessing a back-end seismic server (i.e., Linux cluster). On a stand-alone\\ncomputer, Petrel offers some important methods of reducing the amount of data and optimizing\\nthe data for specific tasks. These are:\\nCropping: for defining a virtual seismic volume that is a spatial sub-volume of the original.\\nRealization: for making a physical representation (a ZGY file) of a virtual volume, or for\\nmaking a new physical representation optimized for specific usage.\\nCropping of the seismic cube allows rapid viewing of 3D data even on standard PCs. Real-time\\nrendering of seismic data can be used for superior quality control of fault planes and surfaces.\\nPetrel also provides scalability for seismic operations through the Seismic server (accessing large\\namount of memory [RAM] and great computing powers from a Linux cluster).\\nHorizons and faults can be interpreted in 3D, which makes it easy to quality control the\\ninterpretation.\\nWhen the interpretation is complete, the 3D grid can be depth converted. It is recommended to\\nbuild the 3D grid in time and use the depth conversion process in Petrel to generate the depth\\nmodel. A virtual link from the seismic time attributes to the depth domain enables the seismic\\nattributes to be visualized in depth.

       "  'content': 'During a Petrel seismic project, the data-tree can grow to such a size that handling the data\\nbecomes quite difficult. Therefore, it is important to manage the data properly. Petrel can handle\\nlarge amounts of seismic data in the form of 2D and 3D surveys and can be accessed through\\nloading from file, from a database using Open Spirit or connecting to a seismic server (3D cubes\\nas ZGY only).\\nThere are two options for storing data on the Seismic Server:\\nProject-specific ZGY file:\\nThe advantage of having projects with specific ZGY files is that they are easy to administrate and\\nideal for a server with few projects. The disadvantage is that the content of a ZGY file can be\\nduplicated several times while it is in use by different projects. Nevertheless, different projects\\ncan contain non-overlapping subsets from one ZGY file.\\nA ZGY file can be dropped into a project from any External Directory (or Working Directory)\\nfolder. When the External Directory (source) and project (target) are located on different servers,\\nthe seismic server copies the ZGY file to the External-Directory on the target server. If there is no\\nExternal Directory on the target server, the ZGY file is copied to the target project directory.\\nShared ZGY file:\\nThe advantage of sharing the ZGY files on an External Data directory is that the files used in\\nseveral projects are not duplicated. This is ideal for a cluster with several users. This solution also\\nrequires more careful data administration and cleanup.\\nTo share a ZGY, drag to the External Data directory. This copies the file physically to the External\\nData directory.\\nSeismic data - Memory management\\nThe BASE system has been created to enable superior memory management for Petrel\\'s\\ngeophysical applications. The better handling of the data and memory access, the better the\\napplication performs for you. In an ideal world, all data should be instantly read into the memory,\\nbut as of today this not the case. Large data volumes take time to read into a fairly limited\\namount of RAM. The smart utilization of this RAM is critical for your Petrel user experience.\\nWhen using the geophysics modules in pre-Petrel 2007.1 versions, the software required large\\namounts of data resided directly in your PC\\'s RAM. As you view larger and larger amounts of data,\\nyour RAM runs out and Petrel either starts to respond sluggishly or, in extreme cases, crashes.\\nThe BASE system enables the seismic modules to have a single \\'chunk\\' of controlled memory,\\ncoupled with an intelligent use of a local disk cache (known as a pagefile). This pagefile is\\nessentially memory mapped data that has been temporarily swapped out of memory, and is\\ncurrently available for seismic interpretation only. For the user, this means better performance\\nand improved stability.\\nWhen running on a 32-bit OS, Petrel can utilize up to 2Gbyte RAM. This can be used up very\\nquickly, especially when displaying lengthy seismic sections in the Interpretation window - either\\n2D or 3D data (because the Interpretation window displays full resolution data, every sample\\nneeds to reside in memory); or when working with modeling modules.\\nThe BASE system starts to allocate memory as the seismic data/interpretation is either displayed\\nor edited. It does not pre-allocate its memory, but will start to fill up from 0 to the set variable\\nlimit (this can be manually set, see Seismic (System settings)). Once the BASE RAM variable limit\\nhas been reached, any \"stale\" interpretation data that is not being actively used can be passed\\nout of RAM and onto the local pagefile, in a format that enables Petrel to rapidly reaccess this\\ninformation if needed. Actually, the BASE system aims to only use 90% of its allocation,\\nmaintaining 10% as spare in case of sudden need. The \"Free Memory\" command will empty the\\nmemory of stale data.\\nZGY is now the standard format for optimized 3D seismic performance. The BASE system\\nrequests the relevant resolution of data for display in a Petrel window. (ZGY data is a multi-\\nresolution format - with data at 7 levels of detail) Only the required data for display is stored in\\nmemory. Once the BASE RAM variable limit has been reached, seismic data is thrown out of\\nmemory - if needed again it is reread from the disk. To speed up the reading of the bulk data\\nfrom the disk, the BASE system uses a multi-threaded approach - using every CPU on your local\\nworkstation to gather the required data for display. When ZGY data resides in RAM, that same\\nRAM-resident data can be used by multiple windows if they are displaying the same data. By\\nallowing different windows to \\'share\\' this data, geophysical processes make very efficient use of\\nmemory. In contrast, for Petrel 2005 seismic interpretation and bulk data, everything needed to\\nreside in memory. Additionally, the toolkit used for rendering seismic in the 3D window also had\\nits own RAM requirements.\\nWhen you save your project, the data in memory plus that in the pagefile will be saved. Note that\\nthe Petrel temporary pagefile will not be deleted upon EXIT - they are removed at the next\\nstartup.\\nUpon startup of Petrel, any windows that are iconized will only call for the data they require when\\nthey are opened.\\nZGY data is read in bricks - each brick is 64*64*64 samples. For 8-bit data, a brick occupies\\napprox 262 Kbytes or 0.2 Mbytes. A brick is the smallest unit that can be read into or thrown out\\nof memory. In the image below, to display an inline (401) requires 12 bricks to be read into\\nmemory. Changing to inline (402) will not require any new bricks to be reread because they are\\nalready in cache, making this a quick process.\\nThe ZGY display option Tile overlap doubles the memory required to display ZGY data. The\\nmemory requirement to store all 7 levels of detail (LODs) will add about 30% to the memory\\nusage.\\nPossible error messages from the seismic BASE\\nsystem.\\nThe most common error messages coming from the BASE system are those related to memory\\nallocation failure. The memory allocation will typically fail if the computer memory is too low or\\nvery fragmented. The Free memory command (Menu bar - Tools - Free memory) can help\\nresolve some of these issues/workflows, but will probably not work for all workflows and\\ninterpretation combinations.\\nSome other error messages related to memory allocation failures are:\\n\"Failed to allocate XX MB memory: std::bad_alloc exception in Shared Buffer\"\\nThe system has failed to find XX of continuous available memory.\\n\"Failed to allocate 256 KB memory: std::bad_alloc exception in cache\"\\n\"std::runtime_error: [ZGYBulkAccessor::accessBrickData] ReadData failed - unable to allocate\\nmemory\"\\nThere are several measures you could try to avoid this.\\nFree memory\\nClose windows\\nTurn off displayed objects.

For example, in the\\ninterpretation window it can be useful to switch between normally migrated and variance seismic\\nfor fault interpretation. Petrel allows the user to use multiple seismic vintages, by switching\\nbetween them rather than having multiple windows open.\\nSeismic vintages are created upon the initial loading of the seismic into a Petrel project. Initially, if\\na seismic cube is loaded into a blank project, a default vintage is given to the seismic or a vintage\\nselection input from the user is required.\\nThe default vintage in a blank project is Seismic Time 1 and can found under the Vintages folder.\\nIf a survey folder already contains a seismic vintage for \"Seismic Time 1\" and another volume is\\nloaded or generated in the same survey, a new vintage will be created. The new vintage is then\\nby default called \"Seismic Time 2\" as the vintage names increases sequentially by the number.\\nNevertheless, vintages can be renamed at any time. If a new volume is loaded into a second\\nsurvey folder, an already existing vintage can be used (that is, the definition of the volume is\\ndifferent since it is a different survey). The vintage of a seismic object can be set after loading in\\nthe Settings dialog, Info tab.\\nGenerating seismic attributes from seismic data will create additional vintages, as will the creation\\nof a mis-tie set. All vintages can be managed in the Survey Manager, alternatively from the\\nVintages folder.\\nIf any unused vintages exist in the project, they can be removed by right-clicking on the Vintages\\nfolder and select Remove unused vintages.\\nSEG-Y Data Import\\nSeismic 3D cubes can be imported as either SEG-Y or ZGY format. Seismic 2D lines can be\\nimported in SEG-Y format. The files will be stored in survey folders. The survey is created when\\ndata is imported, unless the data has been imported directly into an existing survey folder. There\\nare two different SEG-Y import options in Petrel; SEG-Y seismic data and SEG-Y import with\\npreset parameters. Petrel will automatically try to find the correct byte locations for x,y-\\ncoordinates, and so on, using the SEG-Y seismic data format. If you use the SEG-Y Import\\nwith preset parameters option, you have to specify the correct byte locations and you also\\nhave the possibility to scan the file.\\nIt is recommended to follow normal usage of filenames and use the extension to describe\\nfile types. The name of the imported seismic object in Petrel is created from the name of the file,\\nbut ignores the extension. If multiple dots are used in the file name, only that which comes after\\nthe last dot is regarded as the extension. As an example, file SurveyA.FullFold.SEGY.line1 will\\nbe imported as SurveyA.FullFold.SEGY and can lead to multiple objects having the same file\\nname.\\nSEG-Y seismic data\\nPetrel will auto detect whether the input file is 2D or 3D seismic. SEG-Y files detected as having\\nonly one line will be assumed to be 2D seismic.\\nThe SEG-Y reader will use sx, sy for coordinates. If not present, gx, gy will be used.\\nWhenever a new realization of the seismic cube is created within Petrel, the new seismic volume\\nwill be stored in ZGY format.\\nNote that this method uses industry standards for Inline/Crossline number byte locations. If\\nthe automatic line detection method uses the wrong byte position for the parameters, in many\\ncases, Petrel will still import the file. The SEG-Y volume can be used and, in most cases, will\\nbehave correctly. After realizing the volume to a bricked seismic format (ZGY), the new volume\\ncan be sluggish and hard to handle due to the wrong settings. The original SEG-Y file then needs\\nto be re-imported using the SEG-Y Import with preset parameters (recommended).\\nSEG-Y Import with preset parameters\\nIf using the SEG-Y Import with the preset parameters option (recommended), you have to specify\\nthe correct byte locations and you can also scan the file. It is possible to ignore traces with zero\\ncoordinates. SEG-Y loading parameters can be specified automatically from an already loaded\\nSEG-Y file using the blue arrow in the uppermost part in the SEG-Y Import box.\\nThe SEGY headers from first file area of the dialog gives you access to the ASCII header,\\nbinary header and trace header information to identify byte location parameters.\\nThe file can be scanned to check inline and crossline numbers as well as x and y coordinates. A\\nspecified number of traces can be scanned.\\nThe stair-step pattern of the inlines and sawtooth pattern of the crosslines is the expected\\nbehavior of the SEG-Y Scan.\\n2D lines specifics\\nImport of 2D SEG-Y files will gives you an option to specify parameters to correctly define\\ntrace, CDP, and shotpoint numbering.\\n2D seismic lines can be cropped and realized.\\n2D lines can be exported. See section about SEG-Y export.\\nAttributes can be extracted from 2D seismic.\\nReconnect seismic files\\nThe original seismic file is not saved in the Petrel project folder - only a link to the file. Therefore, if you\\nmove the project, the seismic file cannot be found unless its path from the project\\'s new location is\\nunchanged. If the file is not found, its icon changes into a cross to mark it as unreadable like this:\\nTo re-establish the link, move the seismic file to an accessible directory. Open the Settings window for\\nthe seismic cube in the Petrel project and, on the Info tab, type in or browse to the new directory and\\nfile name of the seismic file. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Seismic main folder or a survey\\nfolder (or sub folders) and select the option to Reconnect missing files... . Use the browser to point\\nto the folder where the seismic file(s) are located and click OK . There is also the option to re-import\\nthe files.\\nFig. 1 Right-click menu Reconnect missing files...\\nThe top half of the window list folders where the system is expecting to find seismic data. Beneath this\\nare 3 sub-tabs with different options for the seismic data to be reconnected:\\nSearch in folder structure : You can set the number of folder levels lateral and vertical to\\nsearch within and validate before reconnecting strating from the Initial folder\\nThe option Minimum number of folders in path enables you to control how many\\ndirectories above the file must match to allow the connection to take place.\\nFor example, if the original file location was listed in Petrel as ..\\\\My\\nFiles\\\\Petrel\\\\Seismic\\\\Survey 1\\\\Migrated.zgy\\nSetting the parameter to 0 and starting the search at D:\\\\My Files\\\\Petrel\\\\ would find\\nsuitable a file in the directories\\nD:\\\\My Files\\\\Petrel\\\\Seismic\\\\Survey 1\\\\Migrated.zgy\\nD:\\\\My Files\\\\Petrel\\\\Seismic\\\\Survey 2\\\\Migrated.zgy\\nD:\\\\My Files\\\\Petrel\\\\Temp\\\\datasets\\\\Migrated.zgy\\nThis is because the match is only being made based on the file name. Changing the Minimum\\nnumber of folders in path setting to 1 would require a match with the folder above, and would\\nonly match\\nD:\\\\My Files\\\\Petrel\\\\Seismic\\\\Survey 1\\\\Migrated.zgy\\nNote: By default the first file found is reconnected. If the Advanced selection of files\\noption is used, a new window appears showing how many versions of each file have been found\\nand the file that will be\\nreconnected by default. This can be changed to reconnect to a different file or the user can\\namend the search criteria (paths, folders in path etc) to ensure the correct files are reconnected.\\nFig. 2 Advanced selection of files dialog.\\nSearch in paths - The search id made based on defined paths, these can be set at a corporate\\nlevel.\\nIf data management team wants to move seismic bulk files round the system, they have no way of\\nknowing which Petrel projects are using the files and, therefore, informing users where to find the\\nmoved files. The Seismic Reconnect option allows the creation of disk lists. They can be at a project,\\nsystem, or corporate level and are searched in this order to reconnect to seismic volumes.\\nProject and system disks are set up in Petrel , while corporate disks are read from a text file whose\\nlocation is given via the \"Corporate paths file\".\\nFig. 3 Search in paths tab\\nRe-parent paths - Is very useful when working with USB disks where drive letters change.\\nFiles can be re-parented to locations that do not exist. The option Force re-parent will update the\\nlocation of the seismic to the new parent path even if this location is not accessible on the current\\nmachine. This enables projects to be created with disk paths that are perhaps only visible in a remote\\noffice, or to update seismic file locations before the physical file has been copied there.\\nFig. 4 Re-parent paths tab.\\nThe results of reconnect missing files can be written to the output sheet, providing a record of what\\nhas been done.\\nNote that the original seismic files should never be moved to the project .ptd file. These files are\\ninternal to the Petrel project, and other files in this directory will be deleted by Petrel.\\nZGY Data Import\\nSeismic 3D cubes in ZGY format can be imported and will be stored in survey folders.\\nIf the link to the ZGY file is lost, you will need to re-establish the link. Move the ZGY file to an\\naccessible directory, open the Settings window for the seismic data and, in the Info tab, enter\\nthe new directory and file name of the ZGY file, or browse and select the ZGY file from this tab.\\nAlternatively, you can re-import the file.\\nThe ZGY format is a seismic file where the seismic representation is changed to a bricked format\\nfor rapid display of the seismic (inlines, crosslines, timeslices and cropped volumes). The ZGY files\\ncontain a pre-computed \"level of detail\", which means that the bricks exist with full resolution and\\nlow resolution. When the ZGY file is displayed, only the necessary bricks are loaded into memory.\\nBig bricks with low resolution are loaded into memory first, after which the program will start\\nloading smaller bricks with a higher resolution. The user will perceive the seismic as coarse\\nresolution, but, it will be refined as the program is given time to load smaller bricks into the\\nmemory. The benefits are that large seismic bricked data can be rendered in the 3D window, and\\nuser interactions are always available. The loading of the bricks is stopped if the user moves a\\nseismic line.\\nSee also How to import seismic data into a survey folder .\\nThe benefit of using ZGY bricked seismic data is that large seismic volumes, which are much\\nbigger than the computer\\'s memory, are easily displayed and handled in Petrel.\\nReuse of pre-Petrel 2008.1 projects\\nOnly one seismic volume geometry can exist in a survey folder in Petrel. In pre-petrel 2007.1\\nversions, survey folders could contain multiple geometry volumes and even a combination of 2D\\nand 3D. If such a project is converted to this version of Petrel, it will move all, except the first\\nvolume in each survey folder, into new folders. The new survey folders will be named Converted\\nseismic 1 or Converted 2D seismic dependent on type of seismic that is stored in each folder.\\nSeveral converted survey folders can exist in a converted project.\\nHow to open a pre-Petrel 2007.1 project\\n1. Open the latest version of Petrel.\\n2. In the Menu bar, go to File and select Open project...\\n3. Find the pre-Petrel 2007.1 project and open it. The project will start loading and converting\\nthe seismic data to the new standard. The Petrel message log will open, listing the various\\nconversion steps.\\n4. When the loading is finished, check the log for information.\\n5. Find any pre-existing interpretation folders containing padlocked interpretation. They can\\nbe converted to a survey consistent interpretation if needed.\\n6. Find the seismic data stored in survey folders, alternatively in newly created converted\\nseismic folders. These can all be found under the seismic main folder.\\nWhen realizing seismic data in Petrel 2005 and earlier versions, the following formats were\\nincluded for selection:\\nInteger 64-bit\\nFloating point 64-bit\\nInteger 4-bit\\nInteger 2-bit\\nInteger 1-bit\\nThese value formats are no longer supported in Petrel. When upgrading a pre-Petrel 2007.1\\nproject that contains realized seismic data in any of the above formats, an error message opens\\nand the seismic object is deleted. The source volume or line needs to be reloaded from disk or\\nthrough OpenSpirit.\\nWhen upgrading a P2007.1 project to P2008.1 or later, any existing seismic 2D multilines (i.e.\\nseismic data imported from one SEG-Y file containing multiple 2D lines) are split into separate\\nsingle lines. This has some implications when it comes to the display of already existing composite\\nlines containing parts from the original multiline.\\nBest practice when upgrading pre-Petrel 2007 projects:\\nSave the project in the new version of Petrel, close and load it again. This will free up some\\nmemory.\\nHow to re-display composite lines created from multi 2D lines in Petrel\\n2007.1\\nAny composite line that was created with the use of multi 2D lines in Petrel 2007.1, will not\\ndisplay correctly when upgraded to Petrel 2008.1. This is due to the upgrade procedure that splits\\nthe multiline into single lines. So the source for parts of the composite has changed and needs to\\nbe redirected. The following simple workaround will correct the display problem:\\n1.\\n2.\\n1. After upgrading the project to Petrel 2008.1, find the composite line in the Input pane.\\n2. Click the display of the composite line off in the active window, then redisplay it.\\n3.

       "  'content': \"Realization is the process of creating a physical copy of any seismic volume or 2D line. The\\noriginal seismic can be an imported SEG-Y or ZGY file, a virtual file (for example, a cropped\\nvolume or a cropped 2D line) or even a previously realized volume or 2D line. The output from the\\nrealization process is seismic in ZGY format (3D) or a Petrel raw format (2D). Realization serves\\nthe following important purposes:\\nPurpose 1: Realization creates a physical\\nrepresentation\\nCropping (see Cropping) is a useful operation in itself, but creating a new physical representation\\nof this virtual region of interest can yield yet another performance boost.\\nA realized seismic file is created in ZGY format (3D volumes) or an internal Petrel raw format (2D\\nlines). Also, ZGY files can be imported into other Petrel projects or exported as SEG-Y or ZGY (see\\nSEG-Y and ZGY export).\\nSeismic files realized to ZGY format are noticeably faster in use compared to the original SEG-Y\\nfile.\\nRealization is also useful when you want to compute a complex attribute. Some attributes are\\nexpensive to compute (for example, structural smoothing and chaos). As long as only single\\nsections of a cube will be used, it is beneficial to keep the attribute as a virtual volume to save\\ndisk space. When the attributes are in virtual mode, the attributes displayed in a slice are\\ncalculated, on-the-fly, for each trace. Quick slicing and volume rendering are expensive:\\ntherefore, it is useful to create a physical representation to speed up the visualization. You decide\\nwhat is acceptable. Virtual attributes save disk space when they are calculated on, but the quality\\ncan suffer when you move the slices. Realized attributes utilize quick slicing and volume\\nrendering, but will create a new file in the project and will use more disk space.\\nPurpose 2: Realization can change value resolution\\nMany SEG-Y files use 32-bit floating-point format for the trace amplitude values. This kind of\\nresolution is often unnecessary and adds a certain overhead to all operations on the volume.\\nVolumes and 2D lines realized in Petrel can be given a value resolution of 16-bit or even 8-bit\\nintegers, yielding a gain in available storage space by 50 or 75 percent, respectively. Often, this\\nloss of resolution will not impose any noticeable loss of quality or perceptible information.\\nNote that the original value range is kept, for example, converting a floating point cube to 8-bit\\nwill retain the value range from the original cube, and not use the 8-bit value range (-128 to\\n+127).\\nPurpose 3: Realization changes the data format to\\nZGY bricked format\\nZGY format is a new brick representation of the seismic volume. Using the bricked format, the\\nseismic is stored in bricks of various resolutions (LODs, Level Of Detail) rather then the traditional\\ntrace format. When seismic is displayed, only the bricks needed are loaded into memory. Big\\nbricks with low resolution are loaded into memory first. The program will then start loading the\\nsmaller bricks with high resolution. The seismic appears to be of coarse resolution, but it will\\nrefine as the program is given time to load the smaller bricks into memory. The benefit is that\\nlarge seismic bricked data can be rendered in the 3D window, and user interactions are always\\navailable since the loading of the bricks is stopped if you move a seismic line. Another advantage\\nis that when you are working with very large seismic volumes, rather than reading and\\nattempting to display every seismic sample, only the required resolution of data will be read and\\ndisplayed. Access to ZGY data has been multi-threaded which means that every available CPU on\\nthe computer will be used to grab data as quickly as possible. Hence, the improved access speed\\nas opposed to large SEG-Y files.\\nThe ZGY file can be realized in 8-bit, 16-bit or 32- bit.\\nThe bricked format (ZGY) supports rapid intersection access and volume rendering of large data\\nfiles.\\nRealization guidelines\\nImportant guidelines for Realization\\nRealization is potentially a time-consuming process, and uses a lot of disk space.\\nIt is strongly recommended that your project is saved to a specific location before realizing\\nlarge seismic volumes. If not, the system's temporary directory (for example, C:\\\\TEMP) will\\nbe used for the generated volume file. Subsequently, when you finally do save your project,\\nthe entire realized volume will be moved to the project's location, which can be time-\\nconsuming if this location is on a different file system.\\nIt is strongly recommended that projects with realized volumes be saved to a local hard\\ndisk. Working with volumes is very I/O intensive, so your local area network might not be\\nable to provide the required throughput.\\nIt is strongly recommended that the disk used for realization be defragmented. If the\\nrealized file becomes heavily fragmented, this can severely impact processing and\\nvisualization performance.\\nWhen realizing to ZGY format it is critical to scale the data properly, especially when moving\\nfrom 32-bit SEG-Y to an 8-bit ZGY file. This is because many SEG-Y files contain spikes or\\nerroneous data that, when scaled, will make the data look washed out.\\nFig. 1 The Realize subtab under the Operations tab in the Settings dialog of the seismic\\nvolume.\\nUnder the Operations tab for seismic data, in the Realize subtab, the amplitude range for the\\nrealized seismic data is specified by the user as defined by the Set from source..../User\\ndefined buttons. The Source amplitude range values specifies the range of values currently\\ndefined. A ~ (tilde) in front of the values means that the range is estimated and clicking the Scan\\nbutton will calculate the entire value range. If you select User defined, the value range can be\\nset when realizing the data (that is, clipping seismic), but the Source amplitude range is\\nunaltered. In the Amplitude subtab, you can manually set the value range but that will also\\nchange the Source amplitude range. If this is not wanted, click on the Rescan button and the\\nfull value range is recalculated.\\nIn addition, in the Realize subtab, there is a Zero centric option that ensures that if data is\\nrealized to a lower resolution (8- or 16-bit), the readout of the original amplitude 0.000000 in the\\n32-bit float seismic will stay 0.000000 when realized to 8- or 16-bit data. To get a correct\\nscale/offset value, the minimum amplitude value has to increase to some extent if min/max is not\\nalready a module of the 8- or 16-bit limits.\\nFurther down on the Realize subtab, there is now a histogram display. This histogram can be\\nused to QC data before realization. Note that any changes to the histogram display will not affect\\nthe data, only the displayed histogram. ONLY through/after the Realization process are any\\nchanges applied to the data. The histogram tool has a filter option that excludes the maximum\\nspike in the histogram (for conventional seismic this means crossover (null) values). The\\nhistogram tool also includes the ability to send histogram information to the Petrel message log\\nthat details exactly what data range will be stored in which bin. The message log content can be\\ncopied and pasted into other applications as needed.\\nRealize a 3D seismic volume\\nHow to realize a seismic 3D volume\\n1. Open the Settings dialog from the imported seismic cube and go to the Realize subtab\\nunder the Operations tab.\\n2.

Data read speed from disk can reach 100 MB per second.\\nHowever, in some cases this is not sufficient. With the emerging 64-bit operating systems, it is\\npossible to store data in RAM - Petrel includes an option to prefetch seismic data to cache.\\nSeismic volumes with a size that can reside in the computers memory is possible to Prefetch to\\ncache (independent of operating system, that is, 32-/64-bit). Both SEG-Y and ZGY volumes or\\n2D lines have this option that loads the entire seismic data into memory. This operation will run\\nas a multi-threaded asynchronous task. For users familiar with pre-Petrel 2007 releases, this\\noption is similar to the old Load into memory option.\\nHow to prefetch to cache a seismic data\\nRight-click on a seismic data object; 3D volume or 2D line, either a SEG-Y or ZGY cube, and\\nselect Prefetch to cache from the drop-down menu.\\nDepending on the format of the seismic cube (SEG-Y or ZGY) that is prefetched to cache,\\nthe following will happen:\\nSEG-Y: The task manager opens up (if not already open) below the graphic display area of\\nPetrel and a counter updates until it reaches 100 %. At this point the volume is successfully\\nloaded into cache.\\nZGY: The Petrel message log pops up and reports the Levels of detail (LOD) that is\\nprefetched to cache. When Level 0 (highest level of detail) is completed, the volume is\\nsuccessfully loaded into cache.\\nIf the seismic volume is too large to fit into the cache of your computer, an error message opens\\nup.\\nThe seismic cache size for Petrel can be changed in the System settings, Seismic tab.\\nAlternatively, you can crop down the seismic volume before you try to Prefetch to cache again.\"},\n",

For volumes, the classic seismic sections are inline, crossline, timeslices, and\\nrandomline. In addition, Petrel allows specific seismic sections to be extracted along any given\\npolygon or along any well path. Volumes can also be rendered using filters for extracting the\\npreferred attribute values. This makes a very good visualization tool, as you can play with the\\ntransparency effects and search for objects of interest with known attribute values.\\nThere are two settings in particular in Petrel which allow you to optimize the way the data is\\ndisplayed, depending on the task at hand. The data can be stored in a bricked format called ZGY\\nfor speedy 3D rendering (See Realization), and it can be cropped so that only the area of interest\\nis displayed (see Cropping).\\nVolume Visualization in 3D\\nVolume rendering is controlled from the Settings window of any seismic ZGY format volume (not\\nSEG-Y). This is done by defining the settings in the Style - ZGY style sub-tab, and by setting the\\nopacity curve of the Colors tab. For details about the settings window in general, see Seismic\\nData (Settings), where the settings window is described in its entirety.\\nTo open the settings window for the seismic volume, right-click on the seismic ZGY volume and\\nselect Settings.\\nThe Style tab contains a sub-tab called Volume visualization, which contains the settings\\ndescribing what is to be displayed, that is; Volume walls and Volume render.

When you reach a point where you wish to traverse from the 2D\\nseismic into the 3D cube, you can use either the arbitrary or aligned icons ( , or ). Click\\non any of these icons (activate the 3D survey if they are grayed out), and continue to\\ntraverse through the 3D volume. End the composition by double-clicking the left mouse\\nbutton or by pressing the letter N (shortcut key for Start new line).\\n2. If you start with the 3D volume: Activate the 3D volume on the Seismic input pane. Click\\nany of the two icons , or to compose 3D line parts of the composite. When\\napproaching the 2D lines to include, click the icon and continue to select the 2D lines of\\ninterest.\\nNote: It is important to select which end of the 2D seismic line you want to start the\\ncomposite with. If you select the undesired end of the 2D seismic line, the procedure for flipping\\nthe line to the opposite end includes inserting the composite in an Interpretation window where\\nthe Clip and extend composite icon can be used.

Make sure to enable transparency and change the opacity curve for all segments of the\\ncomposite line.\\nNote: The opacity curve is set for a template which the seismic object is attached to, not the\\nobject itself. Therefore, the same opacity curve is used for all seismic intersections using the\\nsame template (both 2D and 3D).\\nNote: Under settings for the composite line, Style tab and Plane settings, the plane itself\\ncan be displayed (in one color), alternatively with a transparency.\\nComposite lines in an Interpretation window\\nHow to create and handle composite lines in an Interpretation window\\n1.

By using the Compose with\\nintersecting line icon, only intersection lines marked as small triangles above the\\ndisplayed seismic are accessible (both 2D and 3D seismic intersections). The four following\\nsteps describe how an intersecting line is composed with a current selected seismic line.\\nTo compose to the right and use the part of the intersecting line away from you, left-\\nclick on a possible compose location.\\nTo compose to the left and use the part of the intersecting line away from you, press\\nCTRL and left-click on a possible compose location.\\nTo compose to the right and use the part of the intersecting line towards you, press\\nSHIFT and left-click on a possible compose location.\\nTo compose to the left and use the part of the intersecting line towards you, press\\nSHIFT and CTRL and left-click on a possible compose location.\\n3. Using Compose with inline or Compose with crossline , any intersecting 3D line\\nwill be accessible.\\n4. Continue creating the composed line using the different icons.\\n5. To edit on the selected lines comprising the composed line, use the Clip and extend\\ncomposite icon. Its use is explained in the following steps.\\nTo clip out parts of the composed line to the right and extend it from that point on,\\nleft-click where the clip/extend should take place.\\nTo clip out parts of the composed line to the left and extend it from that point on,\\npress CTRL and left click where the clip/extend should take place.\\nTo clip out parts of the composed line to the right without extending it, press SHIFT\\nand left-click where to clip and end the composed line.\\nTo clip out parts of the composed line to the left without extending it, press CTRL and\\nSHIFT and left-click where to clip and end the composed line.\\nNote: The best way of handling and visualizing these steps is to tile your windows (2D, 3D\\nand Interpretation window) and orientate the seismic data in the same direction. It is good\\npractice to copy and paste your composite lines before editing them.\\nFlatten a composite line\\nA composite line displayed in an interpretation window can be flattened on a horizon as any other\\nseismic intersection, with the added functionality to only flatten the part belonging to a specified\\nsurvey.\\n1. Display the interpreted horizon in an Interpretation window containing the composite line.\\n2. Expand the interpreted horizon object in the Input pane.

Click on the triangles on the left and right-hand side of the color bar to rotate the colors.\\nThe Colors tab in the Settings dialog and the Color table toolbar can be used in combination.\\nColor filtering techniques\\nAnother useful function is to filter the seismic 2D or 3D data using an opacity curve accessed\\nthrough the Colors tab, Opacity tab, or the Color table toolbar, see the image below. Specific\\namplitudes can be highlighted to look at particular seismic events, which is useful in detecting\\nsand-bodies with a characteristic amplitude range.\\nColor filtering using Settings dialog\\nColor filtering of 2D lines and seismic intersections from 3D volumes can be controlled in the\\nSettings dialog of the seismic object. There are two options that basically do the same thing and\\nare found on the Colors and Opacity tabs.\\nThe opacity curve in the Colors tab can be edited by using the two lowermost icons. New points\\ncan be added to the curve by left-clicking somewhere on the curve. The active point on the line\\n(highlighted color) can be moved by dragging the points. By changing from the Select Edit Point\\nmode to the Line mode , the whole curve can be moved.\\nClicking on the Reverse Color template icon will invert the color template. If changes have\\nbeen made to the color template, you can click on the Reset color template to default icon\\nto get back to the original template.\\nThe opacity curve in the Opacity tab can be edited by simply clicking inside the graphic area and\\ndragging the area over to make it transparent.\\nNote that the Min/Max values in the Colors tab and histogram distribution in the Opacity\\ntab are defined by how the (amplitude) values are defined. Updating the value distribution is done\\nin the Operations tab of the seismic object. The histogram distribution in the Opacity tab has a\\ncontinous readout of values when moving the cursor over the area. The same readout\\nfunctionality exists for the Color table toolbar.\\nColor filtering using color table tool bar\\nIf the seismic has been scanned (using the scan function under the Seismic -> Settings ->\\nOperations tab -> Realize sub-tab), an opacity histogram can be brought up for the colorbar by\\nright-clicking on the color bar itself. This activates further functionality to set transparency for the\\nseismic.\\nHow to apply transparency on seismic intersections using the color table\\ntoolbar\\n1. Open the Settings window from the seismic data icon.\\n2. Select Enable transparency for intersections on the Style tab -> SEG-Y or ZGY style\\nsub-tabs.\\n3. Make sure the amplitude range has been scanned in the Operations tab. Alternatively, re-\\nscan under the Amplitude sub-tab.\\n4. Insert the color table toolbar from the View menu.\\n5. Richt-click in the color bar in the lower part of the Petrel window.\\n6. Click and drag to update the opacity curve while observing the intersection displayed.\\nTransparency set in the Color table toolbar.\\nTransparency on seismic intersection\\nHow to apply transparency on seismic intersections using the settings\\ndialog\\n1. Open the Settings window from the seismic data icon.\\n2. Select Enable transparency for intersections on the Style tab -> SEG-Y or ZGY style\\nsub-tabs.\\n3. On the Colors tab, click on the Line mode button and move the line in the opacity ruler\\nto the left.\\n4. Apply the new setting. Note that the intersection plane is now transparent.\\n5. Go to the Opacity tab. The grayed out area at the top of the graphic display is adopted\\nfrom the Colors tab settings.\\n6. Click and drag to update the opacity curve (observe how the colors tab has changed) while\\nobserving the intersection displayed.\\nAny changes to the opacity curve under the Color s tab must be applied to take effect,\\nwhile under the Opacity tab any changes are made \"on-the-fly\".\\nFig. 1 Transparency of a Seismic Intersection plane.\\nHighlight a specific amplitude range\\nThe easiest way to highlight a given amplitude range is to use the Colors tab as described below.\\n1. Ensure that an intersection is visible.\\n2. Open the Settings window from the seismic data icon.\\n3. On the Color tab, click on the Line mode button and move the line in the opacity ruler\\nto the left.\\n4. Apply the new setting. Note that the intersection plane is now transparent.\\n5. Activate the Select edit point mode .\\n6. Insert four new points and make a square to filter out a certain amplitude range, see figure\\nbelow.\\n7. Apply the new settings - note that only those amplitudes within the filtered range are\\nvisualized.\\nThis action does not affect the walls of the seismic cube unless the Enable transparency\\nfor walls check box is selected.\\nBy moving the line in the opacity ruler to the center, the intersection will be partly\\ntransparent.\\nMis-tie Analysis\\nMis-tie analysis allows you to extract and apply mis-tie value corrections for 2D seismic\\nsurveys. All lines contained inside a Seismic survey folder or a sub-folder will be used when a\\nMis-tie set is created.\\nA simple, but effective algorithm based upon weighting value assignments using a variance\\ncriterion has been used. It assumes mis-tie values to be random variables. The algorithm satisfies\\nthe following requirements:\\nThe mis-ties should be reduced to a minimum after the error adjustment.\\nThe method should be applicable to any survey configuration.\\nThere should be a way to define a weighting factor to good lines (reference lines) in\\ncomparison to lines showing data of poor quality.\\nThe method should be easily manageable within the current workflow.\\nThe algorithm should be fast and require minimal iteration.\\nMis-tie manager\\nThe Mis-tie manager is an interactive tool for managing the mis-ties in Petrel. You can calculate\\nor specify corrections, select reference lines, deselect lines not to be used for mis-tie analysis, and\\nalso toggle to display 2D lines in the active window.\\nTo generate a Mis-tie set, right-click on a Seismic survey folder (in\\nthis case called \"2D lines for MIS-TIE\") or sub-folder and choose Insert mis-tie set from the\\nmenu. The new mis-tie set is located in a new folder called \"Mis-ties\", under the survey folder that\\nit was created from.\\nWhen a mis-tie set is created, Petrel will extract all crossing points for the 2D lines in the survey\\nfolder and build a color-coded spreadsheet showing all 2D lines and their corresponding\\nintersecting lines. The table looks very similar to the Survey manager, but it has additional\\nfunctionality to work with mis-tie values. It is called Mis-tie manager.\\nThe Mis-tie manager is opened by right-clicking on the Mis-tie set object on the tree and\\nselecting Mis-tie manager.\\nSeveral Mis-tie sets can be defined independently for a 2D Seismic survey. This allows you\\nto analyze mis-ties for different zones in the survey (for example, lower formations and upper\\nformations might need different Mis-tie sets).\\nA new entry is created in the tree under the Mis-ties folder, where all mis-tie sets are kept.\\nA bold display indicates the active Mis-tie set.\\nData in the Mis-tie Manager\\nLine lists the name of the 2D lines.\\nShotpoint lists the crossing Shotpoint number for the lines.\\nCDP lists the crossing CDP number for the lines.\\nTrace lists the crossing trace number for the lines.\\nVertical mis-tie lists the calculated mis-tie for a line and an intersecting line.\\nCorrelation factor lists the calculated correlation factor for a line and an intersecting line.\\nVertical correction lists the estimated vertical correction for the line and the intersecting\\nline.\\nTurn visible indicates what lines are toggled and displayed in the active window. You\\ncan toggle on and off the display for the lines in this spreadsheet, instead of entering the\\nPetrel Input pane. The first column visualizes the original line; the second column\\nvisualizes the mis-tie corrected line.\\nIntersecting line lists the corresponding intersecting line for the line displayed in the Line\\ncolumn.\\nThe Use column allows you to decide to use or to reject a line during the mis-tie process.\\nYou can define which lines are going to be used as reference lines. These lines will not be affected\\nby the mis-tie correction procedure at all. Reference lines are defined dependant upon the survey\\ngeometry, the orientation of certain geological features like faults, etc. In order to set a reference\\nline, toggle on the column with the Lock icon for the corresponding line. Locked lines are not\\ninfluenced by the mis-tie corrections and will appear in bold in the Mis-tie manager .\\nInformation can be sorted on the Mis-tie manager . Double-click on the Line header for\\nexample to sort the table by lines.\\nSettings for the Mis-tie Manager\\nEvery 2D line in the Mis-tie manager is identified by a different color to ease the visualization.\\nThe table provides information for each line regarding the position of the intersecting traces (CDP,\\nTrace number and X,Y coordinates).\\nMis-tie manager functionality toolbar\\nGain - Enable mis-tie corrections for gain (amplitude balancing).\\nVertical - Enable vertical mis-tie corrections. By Default this is enabled.\\nPhase - Enable mis-tie phase corrections.\\nStart , End - Define the top and bottom vertical range value for the corrections\\nestimations. Only one window can be defined at a time. Default range is -250 ms and -2500\\nms.\\nCompute mis-ties - Calculate mis-tie estimate values from the seismic data.\\nConstant, Variable - Select method for calculating the mis-tie corrections.\\nCompute corrections - Calculate mis-tie corrections.\\nRealize - permanently realize mis-tie corrected sections on disk.\\nScroll to top - Scroll to the top of the table.\\nScroll to bottom - Scroll to the bottom of the table.\\nThe gain mis-tie and gain corrections are expressed as a difference to 1.0. For example, a\\ngain mis-tie of 1 means no mis-tie and a gain correction of 0.001 will give the factor 1.001. A gain\\ncorrection of -0.2 will give the factor 0.8.\\nVisualize and Realize Mis-tie corrected lines\\nHow to visualize and control mis-ties on intersecting lines\\n1. Mis-tie values can be easily be visualized for quality control in the 3D window. Use the Mis-\\ntie manager, turn on the visibility of the mis-tie corrected line by toggling the second\\nvisibility column. Do the same operation for any of the intersecting lines.\\n2. To see the effect of the mis-tie correction, change the toggle between the original line and\\nthe mis-tie corrected line and look for the subtle changes when the line shifts.\\n3. You can manually override the computed correction values. Simply enter the desired value\\ndirectly in the corresponding cell on the Mis-tie manager spreadsheet.\\nThe Mis-tie manager window can be dragged outside the Petrel window. This is especially\\nuseful when working with dual-monitor workstations.\\nHow to realize mis-tie corrected lines\\nMis-tie values are applied \"on-the-fly\", generating a virtual mis-tie corrected 2D line that is\\ndisplayed. The system will store the computed values and reapply them every time the line is\\nused for display. This allows you to work on a Mis-tie set interactively while analyzing mis-tie\\ncorrections. It can also save disk space. However, a Mis-tie set can be stored permanently and\\nused separately for later steps in interpretation. For this purpose, it is possible to permanently\\nrealize mis-tie corrected lines on disk. This provides the advantage to generate independent\\nrealized mis-tie-corrected surveys. For more information about realization of seismic data see'},\n",

Petrel will prompt you with a confirmation box called Realize mis-tie corrected seismic\\nasking for the realization quality, vintage name and amplitude settings. When this\\ninformation has been provided, click the OK button.\\n3. You have the option to control the amplitude settings with three options available:\\n4. Petrel will realize all lines and store them under the defined sub-folder. The mis-tie\\ncomputed values are also applied to the survey in the realization step.\\nMis-tie Computation Correction\\nHow to generate mis-tie values\\n1. Enable or disable the type of mis-tie correction to be generated (Gain, Vertical, Phase)\\n2. Define the window for the mis-tie corrections (default is -250 to -2500 ms)\\n3. Optionally, define which lines are going to be reference lines by using the Lock column\\non each of those lines.\\n4. Select the method for the mis-tie corrections (Constant or Variable). Constant is the\\ndefault setting and it will generate a single constant mis-tie value for each line and will\\ncompute the corrections so that the mean shift for all lines will be zero. Variable will\\ngenerate a floating mis-tie correction function for each line.\\n5. Click on the Compute mis-ties button: This will calculate the mis-tie estimates from the\\nseismic data and fill the values in the Mis-tie Manager table.\\n6. Click on the Compute corrections button: This will calculate the mis-tie corrections\\naccording to the settings and it will fill the values in the Mis-tie Manager table.\\nExample using Constant correction: Line slb1 will be corrected using a -0.3 ms vertical shift.\\nExample using Variable correction: Line slb1 will be corrected using a variable correction function\\nthat interpolates the values between every single intersection.\\nThe Correlation factor column indicates the \"quality\" of the correlation between traces at\\nan intersection. Values close to 1.0 and displayed in green, indicate good correlation between\\ntraces; values with lower correlation will be indicated in yellow or red. In such cases, you should\\ncheck the reason for the poor correlation (noise, missing information, end of a line) and take\\nappropriate action, such as avoiding to use this line in the mis-tie process.\\nMapping mis-tie computed values\\nIn order to estimate the distribution of the extracted and computed mis-tie values, it is possible to\\nconvert them to points. These points can be posted on the 2D window or used as input for the\\nMake/edit surface process. When converting to points, the first point found at a crossing will be\\ninserted to the point set.\\n1. To convert a Mis-tie set to points, right-click on the Mis-tie set object in the tree and select the\\nConvert to points... option. A new point folder will be created under the active Mis-tie set.\\n2. The created point set contains all the extracted values as attributes. These can be used as input\\nfor posting or mapping. The example below shows the attribute Vertical correction points\\nposted on the 2D window.\\n3.\\n2.\\n3. The computed mis-tie values can be contoured using the Make/edit surface process under\\nUtilities in the Processes pane.\\n4. Drop the points set as the main input, using the blue arrow, to the Make/edit surface\\ninterface and select the point attribute you want to map.\\nUse the Kriging Interpolation algorithm to generate a contour map that honors single extracted\\npoints, as shown in the figure below.\\nCorrect interpretation using mis-ties\\nAlready interpreted horizons can be corrected with the mis-tie values created in the Mis-tie set.\\nYou have the option to add or subtract the mis-tie correction.\\n1. Activate the mis-tie set to be used for the correction.\\n2. Expand the horizon interpretation object and right-click on the 2D survey tied\\ninterpretation.\\n3. Select Add mis-tie correction or Subtract mis-tie correction from the menu.\\nAdding or subtracting mis-tie corrections on horizon interpretation is purely a vertical\\ncorrection. Gain and phase correction is not used in this operation.\\nReferences and Reading\\nMittal, P.K., Algorithm for error adjustment of potential field data along a survey\\nnetwork, In Society of Exploration Geophysicists, 1984\\nWindows for Seismic Display\\nSeismic data and the resulting interpretation can be displayed in several different windows:\\n3D window\\n2D window or Base map window\\nInterpretation window\\nIntersection window\\nMap window (Not Timeslices)\\nThese windows can be displayed one by one, two by two, on dual screens or all together as a\\nmulti-frame composition.\\nNotice that in most of these windows, other types of data that are available in the project can also\\nbe visualized, such as well data, logs, well tops, model data- such as horizons, zones, property\\ngrids, fluid contacts, simulation grids, etc.\\n2D window/Base map window\\nA 2D window will serve as a base map when the seismic interpretation process is activated.\\nWithin a 2D window or a Base map window, you can display:\\nThe frame of the seismic cube with annotations\\nThe outline of 2D seismic lines with annotations\\nSelected inlines, crosslines, time slices\\nInterpretations of horizons or faults\\nOther data such as wells, surfaces, etc.\\nBase map display for 2D lines\\nSettings for display of 2D seismic lines\\nThe 2D line annotations sub-tab controls the display and annotations of 2D lines in the survey\\nfolder.

Examples of data objects you can display are well paths and logs, well tops,\\nhorizons and faults, 3D grid properties and zonation. The display style for objects is controlled\\nfrom the Settings dialog for the different seismic sections when an Interpretation window is\\nactive .\\nHow to set a distance limit for posted objects in an interpretation window\\nWhen posting objects like well data in an interpretation window, it is beneficial to limit the\\ndistance out to the data to be be displayed. It is only objects in the Input pane that can use a\\ndistance limit. 3D grid objects will be displayed where it intersects with the seismic section.\\n1. With a seismic section displayed in an interpretation window (and posted data like well\\ntops, paths and logs displayed), open the settings for the section. For 3D volumes, go to\\nthe settings for the Inline, Crossline, or Random line. For 2D lines, expand the seismic line\\nobject and open settings for the \"plane\" sub-folder (typically called Seismic 2D line 1).\\n2. Go to the Style tab, Input settings sub-tab.\\n3. Set the appropriate distance limit (in project units).\\n4. Click Apply to change the settings.\\nDisplay horizon interpretation in an\\nInterpretation window\\nAny interpreted points, either generated by interpreting the displayed seismic or on intersecting\\nseismic sections, can be displayed by selecting the interpretation object in the Input pane. The\\ndisplay style of the interpretation is controlled from the object\\'s Settings window.\\n1. Select the interpretation of interest from the Input pane. Select the check box in front of\\nthe name of the object.\\n2. Open the settings for the displayed interpretation. Go to the Style tab.\\n3. Under the 2D and 3D interpretation section, change between Points and Lines and set\\nsuitable parameters if it is interpreted on the displayed seismic object.\\n4. Complete the style settings, depending on what you want to display and if the\\ninterpretation is just intersecting the displayed seismic line, see the following how-tos.\\nThe display of a horizon interpretation in Interpretation windows is also controlled from the\\nInterp survey inclusion filters . This filter folder is found under the Seismic main folder and\\ncontains a Survey of seismic object that only works for Interpretation and Intersection windows\\n(it will be unavailable if a 3D or 2D window is active). The Survey of seismic filter ensures that\\nthe interpretation corresponding to the seismic survey displayed in the window is posted.\\nVisualize previous and next interpretation while\\ninterpreting\\nThe interpretation from neighboring lines can be projected onto the interpretation window while\\ninterpreting. The previous and next projections use the increment set in the General intersection\\nplayer.\\n1. Open the Settings window for the interpretation to be displayed.\\n2. Select to display the previous and/or the next interpretation in the Style tab under Neighbor\\nsections (3D only).\\n3. Adjust the plane step increment in the General intersection player, if needed.\\nHighlight points interpreted on intersecting\\nseismic sections\\nThe crossing points interpreted on intersecting sections are displayed in the interpretation window\\ndependent of type. 2D line interpretation is set differently from 3D cube interpretation which is\\nagain different from horizon interpretation performed on the displayed seismic itself. This is to\\ndifferentiate between the various sources of interpretation.\\n1. Open the settings window for the interpretation to be displayed. Make sure that the horizon\\nconsists of points intersecting the seismic section that is displayed in the Interpretation\\nwindow.\\n2.

In addition, other convenient reference datums can be used, but they will all be defined\\nas the elevation (vertical measurement) from the project reference datum.\\nSRD - for offshore projects it is normally MSL, but as illustrated below, MSL may not be an\\noptimal reference for onshore data with an altitude high above MSL. Worldwide, there are also a\\nfew areas where SRD can be below MSL.\\nFigure 1. SRD and MSL\\nWhen checkshot data is acquired (and processed), there are two important reference datums to\\nbe aware of:\\nCDD - Checkshot depth datum, defines the reference level for the checkshot depth values.\\nIn GeoFrame it is important to be aware that all depth values for the checkshot data are\\nreferenced to the given CDD value and not to KB (or another working datum).\\nETZ - Elevation at time zero; in theory, this is the elevation of the seismic source used in\\nthe checkshot survey (the seismic travel time to a receiver at this level is zero), but during\\nprocessing the checkshot time values may have been converted to another specified level.\\nThese two datums may be equal to KB, but can generally be different. It is critical that you\\nknow how the checkshot data has been acquired and processed before loading any checkshot\\ndata into Petrel or GeoFrame.\\nFigures 2 a and b illustrate two situations where CDD and ETZ are above and below the SRD. It is\\nimportant to understand that while CDD and ETZ represent physical datums for the checkshot\\nmeasurements, the SRD is an \"artificial\" processing datum.\\nFigure 2. CDD, ETZ and SRD\\nIn OpenWorks the checkshot depth datum and the elevation at time zero is one common datum\\n(meaning that CDD=ETZ).\\nIn GeoFrame the SRD is a project setting that can be changed after the checkshot data has been\\nloaded and it is completely independent of the checkshot data itself.\\nOpenWorks does not contain a SRD since this value is defined in the actual SeisWorks project\\n(several SeisWorks projects can be connected to the same OpenWorks project). However, it is\\nrequired that all time depth tables (checkshots) must reference a single time datum. This means\\nthat for OpenWorks/SeisWorks projects the seismic reference datum (SRD), the checkshot depth\\ndatum (CDD) and the checkshot time datum (ETZ) must all be equal!\\nIn Petrel the SRD setting must be defined before checkshot data is imported since the actual\\nSRD value will be used during the checkshot import. By changing the SRD value after the import\\nof checkshot data, the time-depth relationship for existing wells will not be changed. This means\\nthat the TDR will not match the new SRD!\\nConversion between reference levels\\nWhen handling wells in Petrel, the SRD value will only affect the checkshot time values; all depth\\nvalues will always be referenced to MSL.\\nIt is also important to be aware of the following differences between GeoFrame and Petrel:\\nPetrel will apply the depth and time conversions during import (as opposed to GeoFrame\\nwhere the conversions are applied on the fly)\\nIf the SRD is changed in Petrel, it will only affect the data imported after the change. This\\nmeans that all checkshot data loaded before the change is no longer correct and should be\\nre-imported!\\nFor OpenWorks/SeisWorks data all the reference levels are assumed to be identical, meaning that\\nno depth or time conversion is necessary (assuming that Petrel SRD equals SW SRD).\\nConversion of time values\\nIf SRD is not equal to ETZ, the checkshot time values must be converted from the ETZ level to\\nthe SRD level. This means that a constant time shift must be applied to the checkshot time\\nvalues.\\nGeoFrame (and Petrel) will estimate this time shift differently depending on whether ETZ is\\nabove or below SRD.\\nOpenSpirit will not perform any shift of the checkshot time data; meaning that ETZ will always be\\nthe reference datum for the checkshot time values. Petrel will receive the GeoFrame replacement\\nvelocity (V2SD) from OpenSpirit.\\nPetrel has implemented the same logic as GeoFrame and will, if necessary, convert the checkshot\\ntime values to the Petrel SRD.\\nPlease note that in general, the SRD in the original datastore and Petrel do not need to be\\nequal. However, if they are different, the replacement velocities used in the GeoFrame project\\nmay not be optimal. In this case you may want to import the checkshot data from ASCII files\\nsince the replacement velocities can then be re-defined.\\nIn OpenWorks it is possible to define a time shift value associated with the checkshot data (time\\ndepth table). Petrel will read and can optionally apply this time shift. By default, the time shift is\\nnot applied, but this can be changed in the OpenSpiritMapping.xml file (must be done before\\nstarting Petrel).\\nPlease be aware that if the Petrel SRD is different from the SeisWorks SRD, the\\ncheckshot time data will be shifted according to the rules described in the next section.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Synthetic seismograms are the bridges between geological information (well data in depth) and\\ngeophysical information (seismic in time).

Generating synthetic seismograms from density logs, sonic logs and a seismic wavelet\\nby calculating acoustic impedance and reflection coefficients, which are then convolved\\nusing a wavelet.\\nAny changes to the time-depth relationship can be made and seismic horizons can be correlated\\nwith the stratigraphic boundaries identified in the well logs.\\nPetrel offers two different processes to essentially achieve the same goal; generating synthetic\\nseismograms that can be used as a starting point for seismic interpretation.

Damaged logs will create errors in the time depth relationship or artificial\\nresponses in the synthetic seismogram. In the majority of cases, logs will require some\\nconsiderable editing before they can be used to create synthetic seismograms. It is advisable to\\ncreate a copy of the original log, and then edit the damaged areas and interpolate missing areas\\non the copied version. A copy of the log is easily made using the calculator (right-click and select\\nCalculator on the appropriate log). See image below.\\nFig. 1 Well log calculator\\nProblems with the sonic log are perhaps the most critical as the log will be integrated to create a\\ntime depth relationship for the well. Any errors in the log will be propagated throughout the time\\ndepth relationship (at least to the next checkshot). One commonly required edit with regards to\\nsonic logs is despiking. Despiking is achieved using the Log editor (right-click on the log to be\\ndespiked and select Log editor). Choose Despike under the Action #1 column, and set the\\nparameters for the despiking (Standard Deviation and Length).\\nFig. 2 Well log editor - despiking a sonic log\\nLog editing must be done properly. Poor editing will result in an inconsistent time depth\\nrelationship and artificial responses in the synthetic which make an accurate correlation\\nimpossible.\\nWhat causes problems in the sonic log\\nProblems in the sonic log can be caused by:\\nLow transmitter strength - Results in low amplitude responses at the receiver and under\\nextreme conditions, cycle-skipping. This in turn causes generally poor quality and noisy logs. How\\nsuch problems are repaired depends very much on the specific effect.\\nRoad noise - High frequency noise generated by the tool moving along the borehole. This results\\nin random spikes of varying amplitude which must be either clipped or removed manually.\\nAttenuation - Reduced amplitude of the compressional acoustic wave. This is probably the major\\ncause of poor logs and is caused by:\\n1. Low formation velocity - energy is continually refracted back to the borehole during the\\nwave\\'s transit, longer travel times mean more attenuation.\\n2. High porosity - poor grain-grain connections in high porosity layers means that energy is\\ntransmitted to the much slower fluid. This effect is most common at shallow depths.\\n3.\\n4.\\n2.\\n3. Shale content - In laboratory experiments a substantial decrease in signal amplitude has\\nbeen noticed with the addition of small amounts of clay to the formation.\\n4. Thin beds - Reflection and refraction of the wave at bed boundaries attenuates the signal.\\n5. Near borehole alteration - Drilling fluids can cause alteration close to the borehole, reducing\\nthe formation velocity and resulting in refraction and reflection of the wave as it passes in\\nand out of the altered section.\\n6. Non-centered tool - Receiver readings diminish with distance to the formation, so a non-\\ncentered tool can significantly affect the response.\\n7. Borehole rugosity - Energy is lost as the wave is constantly diffracted on the rough borehole\\nwalls. This results in a much longer effective transmitter-receiver spacing, resulting in a loss\\nof signal strength. This rugosity is often caused by alteration of the drilling mud, resulting in\\na number of the other factors listed above.\\n8. Fractures - Acoustic waves meeting fluid filled fractures are transmitted into the fluid phase\\nand then back again. Reflection at both of these boundaries results in considerable loss of\\nenergy.\\n9. Hydrocarbons - gas in high porosity formations causes considerable attenuation of the sonic\\nwave, resulting in anomalously high transit times.\\nWith the amplitude of the wave much smaller, the threshold amplitude for the receiver to register\\nthe arrival is reached much later. This in turn means that velocity is underestimated, resulting in\\n\\'dt-stretch\\', which can be up to 6 usec/ft, as well as an overestimation of porosity of up to 0.05%.\\nIn severe cases, the compressional wave may not be registered at all and the shear wave will\\nappear as the first arrival. This appears on the log as the familiar and easily recognized cycle-\\nskips, where the transit time is obviously much too high, and often has a \"spiky\" appearance.\\nWhat to look for\\nThere are a number of things to look for when QC\\'ing a sonic log for use in generating synthetic\\nseismograms.\\nNever use a raw sonic log - this is unlikely to give useful results.\\nCompare the log with reference logs such as calipers and gamma ray. Areas of \"washout\"\\nwill require editing. Changes due to geology should be correlatable between logs.\\nLook for spikes and abrupt changes in the log. These may be errors and will have a\\nsignificant impact on the resultant seismogram.\\nReplace undefined areas with interpolation from other logs or average values, alternatively\\nuse Neural Nets to generate log values from other wells.\\nCheck the log statistics for extraneous values, typical sonic should lie within 40 to 140 us/ft.\\nCheckshot editing\\nOnce checkshots have been imported (see Import checkshots ) they can be displayed using the\\nSpreadsheet icon , and edited manually.\\nThis is done either by clicking on a cell in the depth or time columns and updating the value, or by\\nmarking the entire row before deleting the entry.\\nMultiple checkshots objects can be merged using the Append points with attribute\\noperation , found in the settings dialog of the checkshots data.\\nAn even better way of displaying and editing the checkshots is to open a new Function window,\\ncrossplot attributes (for example, Z vs. Vint) from the checkshot object and try to identify outliers\\nor abrupt changes in the data set. Use the Select and edit/add points icon (Short cut key E\\n) and click on any point of interest in the function window. The selected entry will be marked in\\nthe spreadsheet and is easy to delete.\\nNote that checkshot data is hard facts, so you need good reasons before you do any\\nextensive editing of the data.\\nWhen the quality check and edit is finalized, the checkshots can further be used in calibrating\\nsonic logs or to directly establish time depth relationships in wells.\\nCreate a log set\\nThe log input used in the Seismic well tie process is not individual logs, but a log set that is\\ncreated well-by-well. Basically, this means that seismic well ties are done for individual wells.\\nA log set can contain all of the logs in a well, independent of type (that is, resistivity, gamma ray,\\nspontaneous potential, etc.). However, only sonic and density logs will be used as input into the\\nSeismic well tie process. All other log types can be displayed in auxiliary log tracks.\\nHow to create a log set\\n1. Right-click on the well of interest, select Insert new log set from the menu.\\n2. Open the settings for the newly created Log Set 1.\\n3. Go to the Components tab, select logs from the Available Logs list and click Add to put\\nthem in the Selected Logs list.

Oil and gas reservoirs usually cause drop-off of high frequency components. It helps\\nto measure cyclicity of geological intervals and can be useful for cross-correlation across faults. It\\ncould also identify contacts between gas and water or gas and oil. Instantaneous frequency tends\\nto be unstable in the presence of noise and is sometimes difficult to interpret.\\nA window length parameter is available (default: 33).\\nInstantaneous frequency is independent of phase and amplitude, and is useful in indicating\\nreservoir rock properties such as hydrocarbon, fracture zones detection, and change in thickness\\nand lateral changes in lithology. Oil and gas reservoirs usually cause drop-off of high frequency\\ncomponents. This attribute helps to measure cyclicity of geological intervals and can be useful for\\ncross-correlation across faults. It could also identify contacts between gas and water or gas and\\noil.\\nInstantaneous phase\\nThe argument of the analytic signal, phase=arctan(g/f). The attribute is calculated on a sample\\nby sample basis without regard of the waveform. The attribute provides an amplitude\\nindependent display which is especially useful for revealing continuatively of reflectors which vary\\ngreatly in their amplitude. It is commonly used to find continuity of weak events and to\\ndistinguish small faults and dipping events. The attribute tends to enhance weak intra-reservoir\\nevents, but also enhance noise. Used together with Cosine of phase.\\nA window length parameter is available (default: 33).\\nInstantaneous phase is a good indicator of continuities, faults, pinch-outs, bed interfaces,\\nsequence boundaries, and regions of on-lap patterns. The Cosine of instantaneous phase is\\ngenerally used due to the amplitude invariant nature of the attribute.\\nInstantaneous quality\\nThe instantaneous quality factor is the ratio of instantaneous frequency to twice the\\ninstantaneous bandwidth.\\nA window length parameter is available (default: 33).\\nInstantaneous quality may indicate fluid content and absorption characteristics of reservoir. This\\nattribute can be used to highlight subtle gas reservoirs or for fracture detection.\\nIso-frequency component\\nThe contribution of individual frequencies to the make-up of the input seismic signal.

The output volume is the local contribution of the selected frequency at each sample\\nposition.\\nDesired frequency (Hertz)\\nThe desired frequency is the isolated frequency component to extract from the input seismic\\nvolume.\"},\n",

Multi\\nlayer neural networks as well as genetic algorithm are combined together in order to provide a\\nrobust and straight forward seismic inversion.\\nThe estimation of rock properties using seismic data and derived attributes has always been a\\nvery important but challenging task. There are several different methods for achieving this goal.\\nAll of them are based on strong and constraining a priori information. The required knowledge of\\nan initial model (cf. for the stochastic inversions), or source wavelet (cf. Colored-, Sparse Spike\\nInversion), is in several cases hard to acquire, if not impossible. Moreover, the result of this kind\\nof inversion is often biased by the input initial model itself.\\nIn the case of Genetic Inversion, the required inputs are limited to the seismic amplitude, and the\\nAcoustic Impedance well logs used as training data. Indeed no single unique wavelet, neither\\ninitial property modeling are needed as inputs prior to run the inversion. A genetic algorithm\\nback-propagates the error in order to update the weights for the neural networks.\\nThe advantage of this new method of generating a property estimation, is that the genetic\\nalgorithm constrains the convergence of the inversion in a way that the chance of achieving a\\nglobal minimum error is much greater than in other previous neural network based inversions.\\nThus, success is quasi absolute. In addition, another advantage of this process is that it is not\\nonly restricted to conventional Acoustic/Elastic impedance inversion, but it can be extended to any\\nkind of petro-physical attribute/parameter, which is linked in a meaningful, and straightforward\\nway to the seismic amplitude or derived attribute data. To be more explicit, all the parameters\\ncontained in the wave-equation are possible candidates (e.g. velocity, density, porosity, bulk\\nmodulus...).\\nThe methodology has been proven valid in a real case study across the Shtokman gas field,\\nRussia. The result was published in Geophysics, vol. 74 (2009), Nonlinear multitrace genetic\\ninversion applied on seismic data across the Shtokman field, offshore northern Russia\\nby Paul C. H. Veeken et al. External link to article: http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.3223314\\nParent topics: Neural Networks Background, Background to Creating Estimation Models\\nGenetic Inversion: Brief explanation of Neural\\nNetworks ang Genetic Algorithms.\\nBasics concepts of Neural networks are described in the \"Neural Network background\" part of the\\nOnline help.\\nThus the theory may not be as detailed as within this part. For further details you may want to\\nlook into existing standard literature (see References) Figure 1 gives you a schematic view of the\\nworkflow of the Genetic inversion behind the user interface.\\nFigure 1: Genetic inversion workflow scheme.\\nThe Neural network used is a common Multi-layer network, with one hidden layer in the case of\\nthe Genetic Inversion (GI) module. The characteristics of the Neuronal workflow are as follows:\\nActivation function (sigmoid function):\\nInput/hidden layer relationship:\\nThe bias of the input layer, and the one of the hidden layer are respectively represented by:\\nThe difference is locate in the fact that the weights update is not done in a classical way.\\nTraditionally, Neuronal processes use a Gradient descendent method (or more elaborated ones\\nlike \"Conjugate gradient\", \"Newton\"...) and back propagate the error in order to converge\\nhopefully to the global minimum.\\nThe introduction of a Genetic Algorithm into the Neural Network common workflow, represents a\\nstep forward with respect to the convergence risk which takes into account local minima as well\\nas the computation time aspect.\\nInitially, what is called population in figure 1, represents a set of 50 input weight combinations\\n(randomly selected), which are all going through the neural network first iteration. The output\\nresult is then compared with the observed datasets (cf. the well logs) by calculating an error\\nfunction. As soon as an error value is computed for each of the 50 input weight combinations, the\\nprocess enters into the Genetic part of the algorithm (see illustration in figure 2):\\nSelection : in analogy to the natural selection hypothesis of C. Darwin which favors only\\nthe best adapted individuals to survive; in this case the survival criteria is given by the\\nindividual with the smallest error.\\nCross-over : during that step \"chromosomes\" (here a \"chromosome\" will be one weight\\ncombination) are exchanging \"genes\" (a \"gene\" is here associated to a single weight, within\\none combination) between each other (the number of genes exchanged can be singular or\\nmultiple). This cross-over phenomenon is occurring with a given probability after and within\\neach iteration.\\nMutation : Again, like in the natural evolution theory, genes are going to be replaced\\nrandomly within chromosomes. This is insuring for the process not to converge to a local\\nminimum. The probability of occurrence is here as well a function of the iteration step itself,\\ne.g. mutation is more likely to happen as soon as the evolution of the error function is\\nreaching a plateau. Nevertheless, in most cases it is much lower than the cross-over\\nprobability.\\nIt is important to note that the population at each iteration of the inversion has a constant\\nnumber (cf. 50). Therefore, even if the selection is reducing the number of the population, by\\ntaking, for example the 10 best ones; applying \"cross-over\" and \"mutation\" to those selected\\ncombinations of weights will recreate a full set of 50 \"chromosomes\" into the population.\\nThe output of this workflow is a non-linear multi-trace operator which will be applied to the whole\\nseismic dataset, and will transform it into the property described by the logs used during the\\ntraining phase. This filter makes the parallel with the wavelet used in common Acoustic\\nImpedance inversions. The derivation of the operator is supported by creating many shifted\\nvolumes of the original seismic cube and feeding them into the neural network engine to power\\nthe genetic inversion (cf.Genetic Inversion parameters ). Vertical shifts in the seismic volume are\\naccounting for vertical mismatch of the non-linear operator, while lateral shifts compensate for\\nlateral dissipation of energy (cf. the operator will take into account the geological structure\\ncharacterized by the continuity of the seismic amplitudes).\\nFigure 2: Schematic explanation on how cross-over and mutation is working.\\nGenetic Inversion parameters\\nThis section explanes the different settings and details on the a priori information needed for\\ngenetic inversion.\\nThe Genetic Inversion module is located within the Volume Attribute library under the\\n\"Stratigraphic methods\" class.

In fact, the Genetic Inversion algorithm is not\\ngoing through any forward modeling step, by computing synthetic dataset in order to estimate\\nthe error function. The process itself is trying to build a function directly in order to go from the\\nSeismic cube vector space into the property space.\\nA conventional inversion scheme is doing everything at once within each iteration (modeling, error\\nfunction computation, back-propagation, model re-estimation...), whereas within the Neural\\nnetwork process the modeling part is done once for all at the end of the learning phase.\\nGenetic Inversion requires only the essentials regarding the inputs. Nevertheless, this does not\\nmean that the input data used does not need any pre-conditioning in order to increase the\\nprobability of success of the process.\\nThe main input data is as follows:\\nSeismic cube.\\nProperty logs.\\nUpper/Lower limit for the training.\\nFrom a strict mathematical view the seismic cube itself does not need any particular pre-\\nprocessing (e.g. like zero-phasing the seismic trace, which is sometimes required in Sparse Spike\\nInversion). Nevertheless in order for the inversion result to match properly the property which is\\ntried to be recovered, by the modeling step; the seismic cube in use should have true amplitudes\\n(no AGC...) a phase signature matching the response to the Acoustic Impedance log and of\\ncourse as less noise as possible. The Well logs must go through a much more elaborated\\nprocessing.\\nFurthermore, the generation of a solid well-tie relationship between wells sampled in depth and\\ntwo-way-traveltime seismic is essential before attempting any Inversion process. Petrel offers a\\ncomprehensive tool to generate Synthetic seismograms for this purpose. Since the Acoustic\\nImpedance logs used as input will have a major role in training the Neural network, a poor well-\\ntie situation will lead to poor or wrong results.\\nA weak point with Genetic Inversion compared to classical methods, where an initial model based\\non the well logs is required, is that the final resolution is less important. The classical methods are\\nusing the higher frequency bandwidth of the well logs (see figure 1), in order to increase the one\\nof the Inverted cube, compared to the Initial seismic input. For the neural network training to\\nsuccess in the creation of an operator which will link the seismic to the property log, both of them\\nshould look \"alike\" in a way (note: Neural Nets, can build a relationship between carrots and\\napples but reality is different).\\nThus, the well logs used for the learning phase, should additionally go through a prior low pass\\nfiltering (with a cutting frequency defined by the seismic spectrum) process. Nevertheless the low\\nfrequency content does not have any negative impact on the Neural nets learning process; so,\\none could even expect to have a noticeable increase in the inverted cube\\'s resolution due to the\\nwell log contribution (cf. seismic cubes have usually a lower threshold in their spectrum range\\nwhich is around 6Hz, for marine acquisition).\\nFigure 1 : Acoustic impedance log (in red), filtered acoustic impedance log (in black, overlaid to\\nthe red). Seismic around the wells (wiggle).\\nFinally the Upper and the Lower limit defined by the \"Top surface/marker\", and \" Bottom\\nsurface/marker\" input parameters, are the only requirement defining kind of a structural\\nboundary for the learning area. Indeed it is recommended to keep this interval (defined by the\\ntop and base surfaces) relatively close in order to get a derived operator which is defined within a\\nstructurally stable area (cf. not taking into account the vertical low wave-number behavior of the\\nsedimentation due to compaction).\\nThe Genetic Inversion process, once it has established the non-linear multi-trace operator linking\\nthe Seismic cube amplitude and the rock property, will then model the latter property all over the\\ncube; even if this filter was only derived within the interval defined by the top and base surfaces.\\nThus one should not take into account the results produced outside the area of interest.\\nGenetic Inversion workflow\\nThe following examples describes the best practices when doing genetic inversion.\\nThe Petrel Inversion module is not restricted to pure Acoustic impedance inversion, but can be\\nextended to any property with some inherent link with respect to the input seismic cube.\\nThree examples will be shown:\\nGenetic Inversion workflow 1: Acoustic Impedance computation\\nGenetic Inversion workflow 2: Porosity cube computation\\nGenetic Inversion workflow 3 : Check for consistent well calibration\\nFigure 1 : General workflow for genetic inversion in Petrel.\\nGenetic Inversion workflow 1: Acoustic\\nImpedance computation\\nFor this specific attribute (Acoustic Impedance), the Genetic Inversion is not the only required\\nmodule to get the inputs you need. In fact, to fulfill all the desired input parameters you should\\nhave a seismic cube. The calibrated AI logs are however a main input a priori parameter.\\nVelocity (Vp, Vs...) and density logs (RhoB...) are can be found within the global well logs list. You\\nhave to derive (using the Well calculator) the Impedance from them (Impedance=Velocity x\\nDensity). Alternatively, you can use a more complex workflow from either \"Synthetics\" in Petrel,\\nor the MMRD module (see. MMRD, Synthetics). The latter ones are not going to be described in\\ndetails in this section.\\nGenerally, the acoustic impedance and other types of reservoir properties are not interesting if\\nthey are computed outside the reservoir limits. You therefore have to specify the Top and Base\\nsurfaces of the area you want to use. Alternatively, you can select a specific area of the global\\nseismic cube by using a cropped volume and running the inversion on the latter one (as Top and\\nBase surfaces are not mandatory inputs).\\nIn order to get the Impedance cube, you have to follow the Workflow described in Genetic\\nInversion workflow . As clearly described in the workflow above, the most important parameter\\nused for the inversion is the set of wells. There are limits to the amount of logs you can use for\\nthe learning phase. A set made of too many wells will cause the inversion to fail because the\\nnumber of unknown parameters will make the whole process unstable. The recommended\\nnumber is around 10. Another important parameter is the spatial distribution of the boreholes\\nwith respects to the geological repartition of the facies. If you take these two facts into account,\\nyou will increase the chance that the derived operator is efficiently characterizing the relationship\\nbetween the seismic and the property.\\nFigure 1 : Impedance cube generated by Genetic Inversion displayed with acoustic impedance\\nlogs.\\nGenetic Inversion workflow 2: Porosity cube\\ncomputation\\nThe initial steps here are the same as for the Acoustic impedance inversion. However, you cannot\\nmanually compute any Porosity logs ( Phi) and instead you have to use the logs obtained from\\nwell measurements. The Genetic Inversion itself works in exactly the same way; it is an operator\\nlinking the seismic impedance (or any type of attribute you want to use) to the Porosity and is\\nderived by using a combination of Neural Network and Genetic Algorithms.\\nBy following the general workflow in Genetic Inversion workflow you can do iterations over the\\nreservoir zones in order to have a derived distribution with respect to a specific sedimentation\\nprocess. This means that you will have to run the inversion for each zone (for example, porosity is\\ndifferent from a shore-face depositional system, to a channel one) specify top and base surface\\nfor each layer and finally use the seismic calculator to get the right property cube (figure 1).\\nFigure 1 : Final property cube with a well displayed on one of the inlines.\\nNote that in figure 2 , the porosity logs displayed are not low-pass filtered. The display is just\\nmade to show that the inversion process, despite the fact that the frequency content of both input\\nparameters, is very robust. This can be verified by applying the \"Blind-well method\" using a set of\\nwells which will not be part of the learning process, but where you will QC that the operator is\\nstable and robust enough to model the input property correctly, even far away from the wells\\nused in the learning process.\\nArriving at this step, you have to populate the geological model, using the inverted cube, and the\\nre-sampling process (Geometrical modeling process -> Seismic resampling).\\nThis specific workflow can be applied to any type of reservoir or rock property which has an\\nexplicit (linear or not) relationship with the seismic amplitude (good examples: Porosity, Density,\\nVelocity, Poisson\\'s coefficient...; bad examples: Permeability, Resistivity...).\\nFigure 3 and 4 allow you to QC the property population by upscaling the Genetic Inverted cube,\\nagainst the traditional Kriging method. Statistics from up-scaled porosity logs compared to the\\nstatistics from the upscaled property cube (highlighted in red within figure 1), give very close\\nresults.\\nFigure 2 : Well section of some of the wells used for the Genetic Inversion. Seismic well section of\\nthe porosity cube, inverted porosity log (in black) with original porosity log (in red) overlaid.\\nIn conclusion, this way of building your geological model can for some reservoir properties be\\nvery interesting ibecause it is a faster way. In addition, the structural repartition of a given\\nproperty will be much more accurate compared to models build using kriging derived methods.\\nFigure 3 : Comparision between statistics from the upscaled porosity logs and the upscaled\\nporosity cube.\\nFigure 4 : Porosity model populated in the 3D grid.\\nGenetic Inversion workflow 3 : Check for\\nconsistent well calibration\\nYou can use the Genetic Inversion as a QC to validate that the well calibration process was done\\ncorrectly prior to any interpretations. Therefore, use the best calibrated one as the input well for\\nthe Neural Network learning phase, and all the other wells as QC wells.\\nNote that the input log is of no importance here as the result does not have any modeling\\npurposes. You can therefore choose between porosity, density, sonic, and so on as the input log\\nfor the inversion.\\nAfter running the process, you can display this in a single well section window: First, the well used\\nfor the training, the initial inputted log overlaying the modeled one to verify that they do match\\ncorrectly. Next, you can display all the QC wells with the same well section template (compare the\\ntwo overlaid curves) in order to QC that there is a correct match between the modeled and the\\ntrue logs. A mismatch does not necessarily mean the inversion failed. Look again at the QC\\nmodeled well log and see if the global shape of the curves match but are shifted up or down\\ncompared to the original logs. This means that the derived operator is good, but the well tying is\\nwrong.\\nYou now have a qualitative and quantitative estimation of the errors made during the well-tie\\nstep.'},\n",

Then a Variance cube needs to be generated that will contain all the discontinuities.\\n3. Alternatively, the Chaos attribute can be generated.\\n4.

This volume needs to be loaded to Petrel first, either using the SEG-Y loader or\\nthe Open-Spirit connectivity.\\n6. Next, the Ant Tracking algorithm generates an enhanced Ant cube. This cube can be used\\nfor manual fault interpretation or, preferably, as input into the Automatic fault extraction\\nprocess.\\n7. If the Automatic fault extraction process is used, based on the set parameters, extracted\\nsurfaces will be generated and saved under a separate folder.\\n8. The new workflow is a top-down approach, where the interpreter interacts with\\nautomatically extracted fault surfaces in a 3D canvas. Several properties are connected\\nwith the surfaces, which the interpreter can use for organizing the data. For example, the\\nsurfaces can be split into groups representing fault systems. The faults that make a system\\nhave common strike, which means that the same stress field has created them in the same\\ntime period.\\nThe new workflow offers:\\n1.\\n1. Increased objectivity: Manual interpretation is highly subjective because it is difficult to\\nmap the discontinuities in the seismic data and understand their nature in 3D. In the new\\nworkflow, the surfaces are objectively extracted using automatic algorithms that work in\\ntrue 3D.\\n2. Increased level of detail: The automatic extraction maps all discontinuities that have\\nsome extent in the data. When mapping surfaces manually, the interpreter typically does\\nnot have time to interpret details.\\n3. Early understanding of fault systems: With automatically extracted surfaces, the\\ninterpreter now starts out with a structural overview of the faults in the area.

Turhan, Attributes Revisited, 1992, revised 2000 - see:\\nhttp://www.rocksolidimages.com/pdf/attrib_revisited.htm\\nAutomatic fault extraction\\nThe Automatic fault extraction process provides a set of interactive tools to extract, display,\\nanalyze, and edit fault-patches. Fault patches can be created from an edge volume and are\\ndesigned to be used on an Ant Tracking attribute. Other edge volumes, like Variance or Chaos,\\ncan also be used in this process.\\nThe fault patches can be generated for a 3D volume, or you can pick one fault at a time using the\\nSeeded 3D fault autotracking tool. When a fault patch set has been created, it can be filtered\\nbased on properties. By default, all the extracted surfaces are displayed. This gives the\\ninterpreter an overview of the possible fault systems in the data. The interpreter will then, using\\nthe surface orientations, split the surfaces into their corresponding systems. Each of these\\nsystems can then be studied and validated separately. This represents an interaction with the\\nresult at a fault system level. If the interpreter finds that a system is due to acquisition footprints\\nfor example, or other coherent noise, the system is simply deleted. If the system is real, the\\ninterpreter will then verify, and if necessary, edit the individual surfaces within the system. This\\ncorresponds to working on the surface level.\\nBy using an interactive Stereonet plot, you can split the extracted surfaces into fault systems. By\\nmarking areas on the Stereonet, only the surfaces whose orientations correspond to these areas\\nwill be displayed. An additional filtering tool uses the histogram of a selected surface property, for\\nexample, size. The classified data in the histogram can be marked so that the surfaces that fall\\ninto these columns are hidden. For example, all small surfaces can be removed by marking the\\nhistogram columns corresponding to small surfaces.\\nBefore you start extracting faults automatically from an ant or edge volume, it is important to\\nquality control the input data. Automatic fault extraction is a very resource intensive operation,\\nthus the input volume should map the fault system as clear as possible. It is recommended to run\\nseveral tests with varied input volumes on smaller sub volumes in areas of interest before\\napplying the parameters to a larger volume.\\nInput for the Automatic fault extraction\\nprocess\\nInput can be:\\nAn Ant tracking attribute created.\\nAttributes which highlight the edge effects (variance, chaos etc.).\\nEven if this Automatic fault extraction process is designed and optimized for the Ant tracking\\nalgorithm, other attributes can be used as well, although better results are expected on an ant\\ntrack attribute.\\nFault Extraction process dialog settings\\nTo open the dialog, double-click on Automatic fault extraction on the Process pane. The\\ndialog consists of three tabs:\\nExtract fault patches: parameter settings and edge volume input selection.\\nSettings: fault patch conversion parameters and smoothing settings.\\nHints: general infomation about the Ant tracking and Fault patch extraction workflow.\\nExtract fault patches tab\\nOn the Extract fault patches tab, you can change the parameters used during the fault\\nextraction. Depending on how you specify the parameters, the process can search for a small or\\nlarge scale fault. The accuracy of the fault picking is also influenced by the parameters available in\\nthis process.\\nFig. 1 The Extract fault patches tab in Automatic fault extraction process dialog.\\nInput seismic edge volume: Seismic edge volume used for the automatic fault patch\\nextraction.

If you select the Set output fault patches name check box, the text field\\nis available for you to name the resulting fault patch set.\\nUse presets ... option gives the user two pre-defined sets of parameters, Normal confidence\\nand High confidence, a pre-defined parameter to identify dominant fault patches, meaning only\\nhigh and well connected values in the input volume will be used for the fault patch extraction if\\nHigh confidence is selected. These parameters can be adjusted by you.\\nExtraction sampling distance controls how close seed points can be set to extract fault\\npatches. Starting from the lowest Inline/Crossline, the algorithm will search a cube with an edge\\nlength defined by the Extraction sampling distance. First, the top 10% of the values within this\\ncube are scanned. The first value found is the seed point. If no value is found, the next 10% are\\nscanned. If no value can be found until the Extraction sampling threshold is reached, no seed\\npoint is set.\\nExtraction sampling threshold controls the value range within the input volume which is\\nconsidered for valid seed points for the fault extraction process. The parameter is expressed in\\n10% increments of the dynamic input volume range. Example: If the input volume has data\\nvalues ranging from -1 to 1 (ant volume) and this parameter is set to \"Top 40%\", then any value\\nabove 0.2 will be considered for a seed point.\\nThe first two parameters control where and how many seed points are set, as well as the value\\nrange being used to set the seed points for the fault extraction process.'},\n",

Fault patches will be close to planar, so the normal is a good representation of its\\norientation. The azimuth [0 - 360] is read along the perimeter of the plot, and the dip [0 -90] is\\nread as the distance from the center. The Azimuth is related to the inline and crossline directions.\\nThe horizontal surface will be plotted in the center of the plot:\\nTwo surfaces having the same azimuth, but conjugate dips, will be plotted symmetrically around\\nthe center of the stereonet:\\nFrom structural geology, it is known that faults appear in systems, that is, they have the same\\nstrike (azimuth) and conjugate dips. The same stress field, indicating that faults have been\\ncreated in the same time period, has created a fault system. On the polar plot, fault systems can\\nbe identified as clusters symmetrical around the center:\\nThe most famous example of a fault system is probably the San Andreas system in California. In\\nthe image, you can see that the San Andreas faults are more or less parallel. On the polar plot,\\nthis would be plotted something like indicated in the pole plot. The black dotted line is a parallel to\\nthe faults, and the blue and yellow dots are the normals of the faults:\\nIcons for the stereonet filter\\nThe following icons are available on the Stereonet tab in the fault patch settings.

Pre-Petrel2007.1\\ninterpretation was treated as a cloud of points and is not fully compatible with the new format.\\nImporting pre-Petrel 2007.1 interpretation\\nThe way Petrel handles and organizes interpretation has changed compared with pre-Petrel\\n2007.1 versions. If you want to import and use already existing, pre-2007.1, interpretation in the\\nnew format, this involves a (simple) conversion step. The new seismic horizon format and its\\nstorage is described below and in Seismic main folder.\\nIn previous Petrel versions (pre-2007.1), interpretation was a collection of points. Now this\\ninterpretation is stored in the form of a grid, per seismic survey where that interpretation exists.\\nThis is why pre-2007.1 interpretation needs to be converted to the new representation. Any point\\nsets loaded or created in Petrel can also be converted to \\'real\\' seismic interpretation using this\\nprocess. During the conversion process, the existing \\'cloud\\' of interpretation points will be\\nmapped to whatever surveys those points intersect with. If the pre-2007.1 interpretation was\\nactually picked in Petrel (as opposed to being loaded via ASCII or OpenSpirit) then this process\\nwill be more robust. If picked in Petrel, the pre-2007.1 interpretation should know to which survey\\nit belongs, and thus only map to those surveys. If the interpretation has been created in Petrel\\nfrom an external source (e.g. OpenSpirit or ASCII), then it can be mapped to multiple surveys.\\nWherever a point that is being converted to interpretation lies within half the trace spacing of a\\nline, it will be stored on that line (and appear under the Seismic horizon in the relevant survey).\\nYou could end up with a single input point being turned into interpretation that exists on multiple\\nsurveys and lines. In that case, manual intervention is required to remove the unwanted points. If\\nthe seismic interpretation is imported from file, a seismic survey needs to be present, or the\\nimport will fail. If the Reference project tool is used to drag the interpretation over from another\\nproject, and no seismic survey exists, nothing can be displayed in an interpretation window.\\nFigure 1. Interpretation folder with pre-2007.1 interpretation (padlocked) and converted\\ninterpretation (with extension [Converted]).\\nSome points may NOT have been converted. These will be stored in a point set with the\\noriginal interpretation name and the suffix \\'(Not Converted)\\'. The results of the interpretation\\nconversion will be highly data dependent. The pre-2007.1 \\'padlocked\\' interpretation object will\\nremain unchanged. When it comes to unconverted points, there are a few things to consider:\\nIn many cases, it has occurred that the input point set contains multiple points (in one case\\n16!) at exactly the same map location, yet they have slightly different depths. In that case\\nonly ONE of those 16 points will be converted to the new interpretation.\\nYou may need to generate the exact trace layout and zoom in very closely on the 2D lines\\nto ascertain why the points have not been converted.\\nIt is possible to right-click on an entire Interpretation folder and convert all the horizons\\ncontained in that folder to the interpretation format at the same time. Depending on the number\\nof surveys and amount of interpretation, this could be a time consuming task.\\nHow to convert pre-Petrel2007.1 interpretation\\n1. Access the pre-Petrel 2007.1 horizon interpretation, either through the reference project\\ntool input, using Import (on selection) or open a pre-Petrel 2007.1 project in the latest\\nPetrel version.\\n2. The imported interpretation appears in the active interpretation tree with a padlock on it. It\\ncannot be edited or interpreted further.\\n3. Right-click on the locked interpretation object and select Convert to interpretation from\\nthe appearing menu.\\n4. Alternatively, use Convert to interpretation (optimized for 2D) if the interpretation to\\nbe converted is specifically 2D interpretation (this method is slightly slower than the\\n\"Convert to interpretation\" method, but works better for 2D data).\\n5. A new seismic horizon container is added, named after the input with the extension\\n[Converted]. It contains the relevant grid of interpretation stored per survey.\\nIn the current version of Petrel, seismic interpretation can only exist in a project if a seismic\\nsurvey folder exists. This folder contains the survey geometry - required for the interpretation as\\nwell as the seismic itself. The seismic bulk data is not needed. But if the Reference Project tool is\\nused to bring interpretation into a new Petrel project for modeling purposes, the relevant\\ninterpretations, plus the relevant survey folders, will need to be transferred - NOT all the seismic\\nbulk data.\\nBest practices when upgrading pre-Petrel 2007.1 projects:\\nSave the project under a different name in this version and load it again. This will free up\\nsome memory.\\nDo not display all the old interpretation into the 3D window. Convert the interpretation to\\nthe new formats. These are much more memory efficient.\\nThe old interpretation points can be attached to the seismic attribute from where it was\\ninterpreted if needed. This is done under the objects Settings dialog, style tab.\\nThe triangulation algorithm for fault interpretation was enhanced in Petrel version 2008.1\\n(and later) and as a concequence the converted fault surface may appear slightly erratic.\\nThe recommended approach is to deselect the surface intersection in the fault objects style\\nsettings.\\nHorizon Interpretation - Memory management\\nSeismic interpretation is read into RAM as needed by the BASE system (see Seismic data -\\nMemory management), but it is managed in a slightly different way than seismic bulk data. Once\\nthe BASE memory allocation has been reached (see note above - currently set to default 500MB),\\nthe interpretation can be temporarily stored in a memory format residing on a local disk. This\\ntemporary storage (or local pagefile) should be a LOCAL disk on your workstation, and should\\nideally be the fastest disk. This will ensure that the passing of data in and out of memory is\\noptimized - meaning less delay for you. In the local pagefile other information, such as the\\nundo/redo history for your interpretation, will also be stored. By default the directory that is used\\nis wherever the windows $TEMP variable points to - normally C:\\\\TEMP. This default directory can\\nbe changed from the Menu bar, Tools and System settings, under the Effects tab (see Effects\\n(System settings)).\\nThe seismic grid renderer using point style has been optimized for exploration scale horizons. The\\npoint renderer has also improved performance when displaying multiple grids at the same time\\n(see more under 3D interpretation settings).\\nThe point renderer style should now be the style of choice when using huge interpretation\\ngrids.'},\n",

The user selects one or\\nmore seedpoints as a basis for the interpretation and Petrel searches outwards from these\\nseedpoints, tracking the seedpoints features to select adjacent points which match the tracking\\ncriteria. Seedpoints can be prepared in advance or picked interactively from a seismic\\nintersection. Parameters for controlling the autotracking are held in the horizons settings,\\nautotracking tab, for information on these criteria see Autotracking Settings.\\nThere are 5 types of autotracking available in Petrel:\\n3D autotracking - Points will be tracked outwards from the seedpoints in all directions.\\nWhen the reflectors are of good quality this method can be a very efficient way of\\ninterpreting through the seismic cube. If you hold down SHIFT before you start, the seeded\\nautotracking will display the tracking on-screen as it progresses.\\n2D autotracking - Points will be tracked in the direction of the selected line\\nintersection.\\nGuided autotracking - You select two points and the tracking will find the best route\\nfrom one to the other. This gives you a high degree of control as to how the interpretation\\nwill develop.\\nPaintbrush autotracking - Points will be tracked outwards from the seedpoints, limited\\nby the cursor box.

Selecting a high-end graphics card is essential for effective and\\nsmooth geobody interpretation. Old, slow cards with less than 256 MB memory will generally lead\\nto poor geobody interpretation performance with low resolution. In addition, graphics card\\nvendors are often updating their drivers to remove bugs and enhance new features. Be sure to\\nalways have up-to-date graphics card drivers installed on your computer. As the graphic card GPU\\nmemory is mapped on the RAM memory, having the possibility to extend the application memory\\nconsumption to the full available RAM is really a must in order to have good performance. This is\\nonly possible using a 64-bit application. Thus, when using a 32-bit Windows a message will open\\nup warning the user that the Geobody Interpretation module will not work in its full capability.\\nGraphics cards\\nProfessional NVIDIA graphics cards (for example, from the Quadro FX series) are highly\\nrecommended. Although geobody interpretation can be used on ATI graphics cards, some\\nfeatures and operations might perform poorly on these.\\nThe Geobody interpretation process uses an interactive visual approach to isolate features in\\nyour seismic data. By using state of the art blending technologies, Petrel can quickly integrate the\\nisolated body into your property model.\\nThe GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is the name of the processor responsible for handling\\ngraphics in new computers. It is similar to the CPU (Central Processing Unit) but a highly\\nparallelized structure makes it very powerful for some special tasks like displaying and\\nsegmenting geobodies.\\nThe GPU has its own physical memory separated from the CPU memory. Data in this memory is\\nnormally visualized on the screen and/or processed very quickly, making it ideal for geobody\\ninterpretation. A drawback is that this memory is usually smaller than the CPU memory making it\\nnecessary to transport data between these two memory storages. Today, it is not possible for a\\ncomputer program to read the amount of physical memory available for the GPU. This parameter\\nmust be set by the user by opening the geobody interpretation process settings and is called\\nRender cache size. This parameter is 180MB by default which is near the maximum limit for 32-bit\\nsystems, but should be extended for 64-bit versions of Petrel. However, this number should not\\nexceed the amount of memory available on the graphics card. The actual amount of available GPU\\nmemory can usually be found in the software provided by the graphics card vendor (NVIDIA\\ngraphics cards: NVIDIA control center and ATI graphics cards: Catalyst control center). This\\nsoftware can be opened on most systems by right-clicking the windows desktop. To find the\\noptimal size of your GPU cache, subtract 100 MB and the Render cache size from the amount of\\nmemory available on your graphics card.\\nBe aware that the GPU memory is shared between the Geobody interpretation process and\\nother Petrel processes. For instance, if you have 512MB available on your graphics card and\\ndisplay a 400 MB probe or geobody, only 112MB will be available for other visual elements.\\nGraphics card memory (in the System settings window) = (Total graphics card memory) -\\n(Render cache size) - (100)\\nLevel Of Details (LOD)\\nGPU Memory limitations in the Geobody interpretation process is handled by LOD (Level Of Detail).\\nThe geobody element (probe or geobody) is rendered brick-by-brick, starting in a coarse LOD and then\\niteratively refined in finer LODs until all the GPU memory is used. If enough memory is available, the\\nwhole probe or geobody will eventually end up in the finest representation (LOD 0, no decimation). If\\nthe memory limit is reached, one or more sub-bricks of the geobody or probe will be in a coarser LOD\\nand decimation will occur. This may lead to a brick effect where areas of the geobody or probe have\\ndifferent LODs. To find the LOD for a probe in a certain area, click the probe while in Pick mode . LOD\\n0 means full resolution. LOD 1 means that the data is decimated by a factor of 2 (see figure below) in\\neach dimension and so on. If you do not reach full resolution, try increasing the GPU memory (if\\npossible), reduce the size of the probe or turn off other visible geobody interpretation objects.'},\n",

The GPU is the place where the majority of the calculations\\nfor graphics in video games and other applications are carried out.\\nPGI is shipped in an installer package that installs on top of Petrel. Existing customers with the\\nSeismic Volume rendering and extraction license will be able to use PGI.\\nPGI uses a volume blending approach to isolate features from seismic data. By using several\\nvisual techniques, the user is able to isolate a data feature. After the feature is isolated, it can be\\nextracted and made into a discreet object covering the isolated feature. What you see is then\\nwhat you pick. The extracted object is called a geobody.\\nWhat is a geobody\\nA geobody is a 3D object extracted from a seismic volume. A geobody can contain several sub\\nelements (Geoblobs). You can build up your 3D object representation by repeatedly extracting\\nmany sub elements. The geobody can be used as input to a property model, surfaces or as a\\nvoxel mask for further seismic visualization.\\nTypical datasets\\nPGI has been used in several different scenarios.

You will design some rectangle or polygons that define the 2D attribute space to be\\nrendered in the 3D canvas. The defined filter (polygon or rectangle) is binary, meaning that what\\nis inside the polygon is 100% opaque while what is outside is 100% transparent. Any intermediate\\nopacity values are not possible. Note that histogram selections are not compatible with crossplot\\nfilters; when you switch from Histogram to Crossplot , the filters will not be complementary\\nand, thus, not added to each other. Nevertheless, they will be kept in memory for a later back-\\nswitch.\\nThe selection can be adjusted or moved around, either by selecting one corner of the polygon,\\nand dragging the latter one to its desired position, or, for the entire polygon by pressing SHIFT\\nand left-clicking (polygon\\'s corners become yellow) within the polygon of interest, and dragging\\nthe entire surface to a new location, using the mouse or the keyboard arrows.\\nAny action in the Opacity selection can be undone and redone, as well as you can reset to the\\ninitial default settings.\\nClasses selection\\nIn addition to opacity selections, you can make your own manual classification, using the same\\ntools as for the opacity filtering process.\\nOnce you have switched from Opacity to Color in the Selection section, 4 default colors\\nbecomes available (red, yellow, green, and blue). You can tune this color selection or use your\\nown color code.\\nYou can now identify seismo-facies classes in the attribute space and assign classes to a given\\narea of interest with the appropriate color. Complex, class-distribution patterns can thus be\\ndesigned, with an on-the-fly update of the probe in the 3D scene, making Quality Control an\\ninherent part of the workflow.\\nCombining the automatic sampling update while moving the probe around with this classification\\ntool, feature detection will be much more effective (for example, AVO classes detection, Fluids,\\netc.). Once you have spotted a feature somewhere in the survey within the attribute domain,\\nother features can be tracked and detected in other unexplored places of the volume by displacing\\nthe probe, keeping the class defined in the Crossplot view.\\nSelection manager\\nFor the sake of a good organization and to better manage the huge amounts of classifications that\\ncan be generated, the capability of storing the selections has been developed.\\nOnce a classification has been made or a complex opacity filter has been designed, the latter ones\\ncan be stored, and new ones can then be generated, and stored as well. After several iterations, it\\nis possible to open the Crossplot Selection s manager and compare the different classifications\\ntogether, and, thus, evaluate the different possibilities in order to pick the best one.

       "  'content': 'The geobody object (constituted of so-called Geoblobs) is characterized by its geological feature\\n(for example, a channel, reef, cave, slumps, collapse features, salt dome, etc.) and has to pass its\\nadded value into the next step, which can be either interpretation or modeling.\\nBasically, there are three options for converting the geobody:\\nConvert to Seismic Horizons : Is very useful when you have picked a reef or a salt dome to be\\nincluded into the interpretation and/or the velocity model.\\nConvert to Points: Intermediate step for Neural Network training (see the Workflows section),\\nor property population.\\nConvert to Model Property : In order to include the latter one into the geological model and,\\nthus, having a true deterministic approach with the correct petrophysical properties distribution.\\nConvert Geobody to Seismic Horizon\\nThe transformation of a geobody into a seismic horizon can help the interpreter understand\\ncomplicated structures by squeezing the 3D volume and shape information into a 2,5D map. The\\nprocess can plot the extracted body thickness onto surfaces that represent the top, center or\\nbottom of the latter volume. This thickness as well as the concept of top, center, and bottom are\\ndefined relatively to the Z axis.\\nYou have control over the location where the output data is going to be stored (a new\\nInterpretation folder can be created for this purpose).\\nConvert Geobody to Points\\nThis step is very much complementary to \"Geoblob management\" where you can transfer all the\\nfacies attributes defined for each geoblob to a point set for further processing (for example,\\nNeural Network classification: see the Workflows section, property upscaling )\\nIn this case, there are options that are similar to the Geobody-to-horizon conversion process. By\\ndefault, the conversion will insert an attribute to a single point-set that can either be the Geoblob\\nID or the property; the latter one is selected by default. Of course, it will be possible to convert\\neach geoblob into a separate point-set with no attributes underneath.\\nConvert Geobody to property\\nThe two first options are strait forward; right-click on the Geobody and the result is almost\\ninstantaneous.\\nThe conversion and integration into a geological model is more time consuming. Moreover, the time\\nconsumption is not the only issue; in order to model the geological feature correctly, you have to\\nconsider some basic geometrical concepts.\\nThe voxel size is characterized by the smallest resolution volume within the seismic cube, which is:\\nIf the model\\'s cell size is smaller than the voxel in one direction or the other, you will start seeing\\ngaps regularly spaced along the latter orientation. The figure below illustrates a case where the I- and\\nJ increments in the model are one 10th smaller than in the inline and crossline directions. You can see\\nthat every 10 cell-line in the model is not populated with a property.\\nThis effect is geometrically explained by the scheme in next figure\\nThe modeling where you can convert from Voxel to Cell, offers two options:\\nMap from voxel to cell (which is the default option described above. It has the advantage of\\nbeing faster than the other option).\\nMap from cell to voxel.\\nThe latter option proceeds in almost the same way as the first one, except that it takes the center of\\nthe cell into account instead of the center of the voxel. Thus, it is checking that a cell-center is within\\na voxel or not. If the cell center is within a voxel, Petrel assignings the value given by the user into\\nthe cell (see the Assignment option in the figure below). If not, the cell stays empty.\\nNote that this option deals badly with the outer shape of the Geobody. That is especially the case if\\nthe latter one is very thin or if the 3D grid has an unconventional structure.\\nTo minimize this side effect, you can select the Check cell corners check box, which verifies, in\\naddition to the cell center, if the corners of the cells are located within a voxel. Nevertheless, if the\\nGeobody is thinner than half of the k increment of the cell, this option has limited value.\\nKeep in mind that if you use the Check cell corners option along with the Map from cell to voxel\\noption, the time consumtion of the conversion will increase drastically (multiplied by 9). Therefore,\\nyou should consider the time versus quality ratio.\\nConverting Probe to ZGY cube\\nIt is possible now to convert the probe to a ZGY cube. This process creates a cube which reflects\\nthe opacity level of the probe. The output cube has a value range between 0 (no opacity) and 1\\n(full opacity). This cube can be useful as input to the Seismic calculator or as a soft property\\ninput for the Property modeling process.\\nOpacity conversion\\nAs neither the probe nor the geobody are end products within the workflow; conversions from the\\nlatter ones into traditional Petrel objects is required. With respect to the Seismic probe (box, well,\\nor horizon), it is possible to convert it into a seismic ZGY cube (Petrel format). By default, the\\nnewly created cube will be stored in the survey of the cube the probe was attached to, but you\\ncan chose to save it in a new survey (see destination survey in the figure below). The geometry of\\nthe new ZGY cube will by default be the smallest cube, parallel to the survey, that can contain the\\nprobe regardless of the probe type. This is characterized by the Seismic extent where you can\\nchose between Wrap around probe (the default option), or Same as source seismic (the\\ngenerated cube will have the geometry of the seismic survey).\\nThe amplitude of the cube that is created from this process will be scaled based on the opacity\\nfunction defined in the Opacity tab of the converted probe. The resulting cube will have an output\\namplitude range of [0;1], where 1 represents 100% opaque and 0 represents 100% transparent.\\nThe color distribution of the latter cube is characterized by the variance template.\\nIn order to generate a normalized seismic amplitude cube, you can use the Seismic calculator\\nand combine both the post-stack seismic cube and the opacity cube by multiplying them together.\\nNote that the two cubes must have the same geometry prior to any calculator operation.\\nFig. 2 A simple example of a stair-step function (jumping from 0 to 40%) in the opacity domain,\\nwhich corresponds to the two spikes you have converted: one a 0 and one at 0.4.\\nOpacity ZGY cubes can be created from probes rendering 1, 2, (in Histogram of Crossplot\\nmode) or 3 seismic cubes, in any blending modes.\\nClass cube generation\\nThe creation of class cubes can only be made in accordance with a color selection in the\\nCrossplot mode, while rendering two seismic cubes (Cross-plot class extraction is activated).\\nSelecting the Cross-plot class extraction check box will generate a cube that contains as many\\nclasses as the number of different colors you have defined in the Crossplot mode. The color\\ncode will be respected and, thus, the conversion process will generate a new template containing\\nthe user-defined colors taken from the color selection.\\nThe latter one will be stored under Other templates in the Template pane and will have the\\nname \"Classification\" (can be edited). The newly created cube will be stored in 8-bit format, which\\nmeans that you can create up to 128 classes to be converted into the ZGY format from the\\nCrossplot tab.

Moreover,\\nthe extracted geobody is not an end result, but needs to be part of a more advanced workflow\\nwhere it can be used for several purposes (for example, velocity modeling, facies modeling,\\nvolume estimation).\\nGeobody Interpretation and Genetic Inversion\\nThis workflow will show how a combination of the Genetic Inversion and Geobody\\nInterpretation modules can help to link geophysics with modeling.\\nThe combination of this two modules of Petrel are providing results that are going beyond simple\\ngeophysical use. In addition, interactivity and quality control done on-the-fly in this fast process\\nwill add a remarkable value to the modeling workflow.\\n1. Compute Acoustic Impedance cube\\nWhen we use the Genetic inversion in order to populate a model with a given property, we\\nautomatically make the assumption that the latter property is the only parameter responsible for\\nthe variation of the seismic signal in amplitude and shape, and thus, that all of the other reservoir\\nparameters do not have any influence, or do not \"parasitize\" the seismic signal. This\\napproximation is quite important and even doubtable when you are looking at a full reservoir\\nscale where facies changes, compaction, cementation processes occurs and do have a dramatic\\nimpact on the seismic signal. Thus, in order to reduce this uncertainty you can subdivide the\\nreservoir in layers where the facies is constant, the fluid saturation is constant and uniform, and\\nso on. Another reason why we compute the inversion within specific zones is linked to the fact\\nthat the frequency content of the Acoustic Impedance logs has a larger band-width compared to\\nthe seismic amplitude cube, especially in the lower part of the spectrum. Indeed, the lower\\nfrequency limit for marine seismic is around 5-6Hz, whereas the logs contains much lower\\nfrequencies (for example, trends). This means that this part of the spectrum cannot be modeled\\nwithin the seismic.\\nA way to overcome this issue is to sub-divide the inversion into layers where the lower frequency\\ncontent is the same as the seismic. For example, in a time window of 200ms, you cannot find\\nfrequencies lower than 5Hz.\\n2. Generate a Seismo-Facies cube\\nBased on the inverted Acoustic Impedance cube, and some relevant attributes (in this case, the\\ndominant frequency), you can isolate different classes, following some regional facies charts or\\nsimply by visual interpretation, using the Crossplotting tool in the Geobody Interpretation\\nmodule.\\nOnce quality controlled and converted into ZGY format, the next step is to upscale it into a\\npreviously created Structural Grid (based on the Seismic Interpretation). Each interpreted class\\nneeds to get assigned a given facies. The upscaling has to be done for the Acoustic Impedance\\ncube as well.\\nNow, you have set the fundaments for modeling the properties that are correlated with the\\nAcoustic Impedance dependent to the environment of deposition (for example, facies).\\nIn this case, the density was a good candidate as the correlation with AI was 85%.

This\\nmodule in Petrel has a number of features to make velocity modeling straightforward in many\\ncircumstances. In addition to these set methods, you have full access to the data so you can take\\ncontrol of the velocity model and take advantage of the other tools in Petrel.\\nWhat method you use will depend on the available data, but a few of the options are described\\nbelow.\\nIdentifying and removing poor quality well\\ntops\\nWell tops can be inaccurate due to poor deviation surveys or complex stratigraphy. They can be\\nremoved from the velocity modeling process without being deleted simply by toggling them off for\\ndepth conversion.\\nIn the well tops spreadsheet, there are two options; Used by Depth Conversion and Used by\\nGeo Modeling . Turning them off will remove the well top from the Make Velocity Model\\nprocess and Make Surface , Make Horizons , Make Zones, etc.\\nThere are also a few easy ways to identify poor well tops. First, run the velocity model using the\\nwell tops as correction and in the Correction and output sub-tab, toggle on Well points and\\nAdd residual on well tops for the final velocity model. The velocities used and residuals at the\\nwell tops will be written as well top attributes and can then be browsed to find inconcistencies.\\nHow to identify and remove poor well tops in velocity modeling\\n1. Create the velocity model using well correction and output the residuals and well data onto\\nthe well tops.\\n2. Display the relevant well tops in a 3D window and choose Any as the depth scale.\\n3. Open the well tops spreadsheet.\\n4. Check on the desired attribute to test (residual or velocity) to display the values.\\n5. Right-click on the attribute and choose use as Z position. Unusually high or low values will\\nnow be obvious (change the vertical scale to accentuate differences). The velocity surface\\nfrom the velocity model can also be displayed to see the effect of extreme values.\\n6. Select the Make/edit well tops process and select the extreme well tops in the 3D window,\\nthe same well top will be selected in the well top table.\\n7. Uncheck the Used by Depth Conversion option for the extreme well tops.\\n8. Re run the Make velocity model again.\\n7.\\n8.\\nOutliers in the residuals can also be identified by using a function window. Open the Well\\ntops spreadsheet and a funcion window. Expand the Well tops attributes folder and cross plot\\ndepth (Z) or time (TWT auto) against the Z or Residual derived from the velocity model. Use the\\nSelect and edit/add points icon and click on the a point deviating from the trend. The\\ncorresponding row will be marked in the Well tops spreadsheet.\\nPreparing well velocity data\\nIt is easy to open the make Velocity modeling process and quickly create a velocity model. However,\\nthe estimation of realistic velocity model parameters involves a delicate balance of well and surface\\ndata (see Velocity modeling algorithms for a detailed description of the algorithm). Small errors and\\ninconsistencies in the input data will often lead to dramatic errors in the result. This makes QC of the\\ninput data a very important step in the velocity modeling process.\\nA few examples of well velocity QC are:\\nInterval velocity is the closest equivalent in the raw data of the instantaneous velocity used by\\nPetrel in the velocity modeling process. It is useful to create and view this data before building\\nthe velocity model.\\nPetrel will calculate bad V0 and K parameters if there are anomalous velocities in the input data.\\nThese should be removed before proceeding with the velocity modeling.\\nCross-plotting the velocity data is necessary to confirm that the Linvel law is applicable. You\\nshould remove outliers, and look for zones in which a linear trend can be distinguished. These\\nplots can also show whether constant values can be used, or whether a surface is required.\\nQC of the tie of time structure well tops is important as a poor well tie in time will lead to\\nconflicts in the estimation algorithm. A mismatch can be tolerated, but only within reasonable\\nlimits, and consistently throughout the dataset.\\nHow to derive and view interval velocities from checkshots\\nPetrel will automatically derive Average velocity and Interval velocity logs for checkshot objects.\\nThis provides you with the advantage of plotting those values directly on a Function window and\\nvisually look for problems within the data. The Function window provides a link to the spreadsheet\\nview of the data, so that you can select any point (or points) in the plot and highlight the\\ncorresponding row in the spreadsheet. Next, you can decide whether to edit or delete the data point.\\n1. Right-click on the checkshots object and select Spreadsheet.\\n2. Open a function window, and plot Interval velocity against TWT picked values.\\n3. Identify any outliers, use the Select and edit/add points icon and click on any outlier.\\n4. The corresponding row in the spreadsheet is highlighted and can be edited or deleted.\\n2.\\n3.\\n4.\\n5. Both Average and Interval velocities from well TDR can be displayed in a Well section window,\\nboth have pre-defined templates for display.\\nHow to create an Interval velocity point attribute for the checkshots\\nAllthough the Interval velocity attribute exists for the checkshots object, a point attribute for the\\ninterval velocity is convenient to have for QC of the checkshots data.\\n1. Right-click on the attributes folder of the checkshots and select Insert new attribute .\\n2. Select type Continuous , and select the interval velocity property template in the settings\\ndialogue which appears. Also give itt an appropriate name.\\n3. Open the spreadsheet for the checkshots.\\n4. Copy and paste the values of the existing interval velocity (Interval Velocity) attribute into the\\nblank attribute column.\\n4.\\nHow to find and edit bad velocity values\\n1. Create an interval velocity point attribute on the checkshots as described in How to create an\\nInterval velocity point attribute for the checkshots\\n2. Display the wells in a well section window.\\n3. Display the interval velocity attribute (easiest to see on the newly created point data). Use\\nSSTVD as the depth setting. In the left-hand track within the figure below, spurious values stand\\nout clearly as outliers from the dominant trend.\\n4. Open the spreadsheet for the checkshots and delete rows with bad values.

There\\nis rarely sufficient data to accurately determine k for each well, and combinations of extrapolated\\nk and V values away from the wells may not be sensible. To help reduce this problem, Petrel\\n0\\ngives you an option to set the minimum number of TDR samples in a zone before excluding wells.\\nVelocity modeling often involves several iterations of reviewing and updating of the models. A\\nhigh quality velocity model is seldom produced in the first run.\\nA few workflow suggestions are described below.\\nBegin without using well correction. With the well correction turned on, any large errors in\\nthe model will be disguised by the correction and problems can become difficult to see.\\nWhen the velocity model result converges on the well tops and you are satisfied, then turn\\non the correction and run the model once more with the optimized parameter setting in the\\nprocess.\\nIn the first iteration, use the Well TDR - Surface option for both k and V . In the Well TDR\\n0\\nestimation sub-tab use Optimize for estimation of K and Estimate and adjust to\\nbase. Look at the resulting surfaces for V and k, these will highlight problems in the data.\\n0\\nFor the final conversion where correction to well tops is done it is recommended to use\\nconstant k and a V as Correction - Surface. There is rarely enough data in each well to\\n0\\ncalculate a robust value of k for each well and since V is derived as a surface that is\\n0\\ncorrected to the well tops a consistent velocity model is generated.\\nProblem wells can be fixed by removing poor data points in the time depth relationship. Use\\nthe depth tolerances to remove data from very thin zones which may be inaccurate (see\\nCorrection and output sub-tab (Make velocity model settings) for details). Also use the\\nRobust estimation methods (using well or data weights) to reduce the effects of outliers\\nin the input data. If the problems persist, extreme data points needs to be removed.\\nThe velocity modeling process provides numerous types of output data which can be used to QC\\nthe results. See Correction and output sub-tab (Make velocity model settings) for details on which\\nare available.\\nA few examples of velocity model QCs:\\nCheck the output V and k well data points. All values should be reasonable, and adjacent\\n0\\nwells should have similar values. Variations across the model should be systematic, not\\nmerely noisy. This may indicate wells with poor input data.\\nCheck the output V and k surfaces against well data points by setting the point\\'s V or k as\\n0 0\\nthe Z attribute (in other words, right-click on the attribute you want and select Use as\\nvisual vertical position), the points should plot on the surface. Are trends extrapolated\\ntoo far, or should the surfaces be truncated? If the wells are close together, then small\\ndiscrepancies in the values may create a trend that is extrapolated to extreme levels;\\nremove one of the wells from the model if the cause of the spike cannot be edited.\\nThe Velocity log output can be plotted in the well section panel and compared with the\\nInterval velocity attribute for the check shots. The 2 logs should overlie when plotted using\\nthe same scale.\\nCheck the well correction report for anomalous large residuals. If the corrections are large\\nin particular wells, review the inputs. The time depth relationship may be incorrect or the\\nseismic picks may be bad (run synthetics), or the well pick may be poor (re-pick or turn off\\ncorrection on the well top spreadsheet).\\n1.\\nHow to QC the modeled velocity logs against the raw data\\n1.

Display the check-shots interval velocity attribute\\n4. Display the velocity log from velocity modeling. This log will be inserted under the Global\\nwell logs folder.\\n5. Set both logs to display with the same scale.

If the\\nzones are thin, there may be a significant discrepancy between their thickness in time and their\\nthickness in depth at each well. This requires unrealistic velocities if the well tops are going to\\nmatch.\\nIn this instance, it is not possible to honor all the data, so you have three options:\\n1. Honor all the well tops, interpretation is inaccurate - In this case, the well tops can\\nbe used directly for correction, a velocity model chosen, e.g. V=V =V where V :'},\n",

Use the tops for correction as in the first example, however, on the\\nCorrection and output sub-tab increase the tolerance for depth and time.

These points can then be used as input to the make surface\\nprocess where you have full control over the interpolation. The result can then be used as input to\\nthe velocity modeling process directly.\\nWithin the make surface process, you can choose different algorithms for interpolation, use a\\ntrend surface to steer the interpolation, add fault lines as a break in the interpolation, etc. See\\nMake/Edit Surface for more details.\\nIf the resulting map does not match the well data and well correction is turned on, then the\\nmap will be adjusted to match the wells. If this is not required, turn off the well correction.\\nManually editing velocity surfaces\\nUsing well ties and interpretation directly is often a good way to get an initial velocity model.\\nHowever, there may be specific reasons why you need more control over the interpolation.\\nFirst, run the velocity model with the appropriate settings and well control. The velocity model will\\nappear on the Models tab and will include the velocity surfaces created from the velocity model\\nand well correction (use V0 (Corrected)). Right-click on this surface and select Convert to\\nseparate surface, the surface will appear on the Input pane. This surface can now be edited\\nusing the Edit surface option and used as input to the velocity modeling process.\\nIf the resulting map does not match, turn on the well data and well correction and the map\\nwill be adjusted to match the wells.\\nExtracting interval velocity point-sets from\\nWell TDR\\nAn option to extract Interval velocities as scatter point-sets for a defined layer from Well TDR\\ndata exists. This opens up possibilities to first QC layer-consistent velocities and then to grid &\\ncontour interval velocity surfaces using more elaborated gridding and contouring methods,\\nincluding kriging, co-krgging, or adding extra points to control the extrapolation of velocities in\\nareas with no well control. This method is less automatic, but it has the advantage to provide a\\nvery good control on the data being used to build a velocity model.\\nThe options are available from the Settings for a ceckshot object, under the Operations tab.

You can use the filter options in Petrel to select any region in the Function window\\nand see where the Interval velocity values correspond in the geographical space. Using the\\nSelect using freehand draw icon to draw an area in the Function window around the points\\nyou want to filter. This creates a filter set in the Petrel Input tree that filters on the points in 3D\\nview when activated. The active free hand draw polygon can be moved around in the function\\nwindow and the 3D window will update on the points inside and outside the filter selection.\\nYou can also highlight single values and open the spreadsheet corresponding to the Interval\\nVelocity point-set to edit a value if required. Applying the change in the spreadsheet will commit\\nthe change in the point-set and update the display in the Function window accordingly.\\nFinally, using the Make/edit surface process in Petrel, you can grid and contour the Interval\\nvelocities. It is here where you can opt to use a more elaborated approach, like co-kriging as one\\nexample. Please refer to the documentation and help for the Make/edit surface process for further\\ndetails on this topic.\\nRepeating this process for all layers needed will supply the input for making a velocity model\\nbased on Interval velocity surfaces.\\nCreating a 3D grid for velocity modeling\\nThere are a number of reasons why the user may wish to create a grid for velocity modeling:\\n1. To interpolate velocity data in 3D using the full range of property modeling tools (data\\nanalysis, petrophysical modeling).\\n2. To create complex velocity functions.\\n3. To deal with varying velocity functions under reverse faults.\\nIf the interpolation is only required for the reservoir interval (i.e. the zones above the reservoir\\nhave a velocity model defined using maps), then the standard 3D grid can be used. However, if\\nthe entire velocity model is to be defined, then the grid must extend to the surface and a separate\\ngrid should be created. This may also be preferable if the reservoir grid has a large number of\\ngrid cells and is slow to use.\\nIf faults are insignificant, then it may be worth using the Make simple grid process. Drop the\\nprinciple horizons into the process to create the zones for modeling, and divide the model in the\\nvertical direction using the Layering process. Remember that the grid resolution should match the\\ndensity and scale of the data. There is no need to create a high resolution grid to model stacking\\nvelocities which have high uncertainty and are averaged over a relatively large volume.\\nYou are now ready to use the standard property modeling workflows to create a velocity property\\nin the 3D grid. Once created, the property model can either be used directly or V maps\\n0\\nextracted.\\nOnce the velocity model has been created, it can be used to convert any data. The velocity\\nmodel can be defined using a coarse 3D model but used to depth convert a fine scale geological\\nmodel.\\nUsing stacking velocities\\nStacking velocities can be loaded into Petrel as “Petrel points with attributes (ASCII) (*.*)”,\\nprovided the files contain X, Y coordinate information. Additionally, a few common formats have\\nbeen added to the loader to support ASCII-Stacking Velocity files where there is only information\\nrelated to 2D and 3D surveys and the X, Y coordinates are not defined. The corresponding 2D or\\n3D surveys must be defined in Petrel before attempting to load these types of files. Petrel will try\\nto match the name of the survey and/or the names of the 2D lines. Formats supported are\\n“ESSOV2”, “STATOILH2” and “DISKOS”.\\nStacking velocities must first be converted using the Dix formula. Initially, import the velocities\\nusing the appropriate format, then create average velocities using the Dix conversion found\\nunder Points operations in the Operations tab. As a result, new attributes are created for the\\npoint data set. Interval and average velocitiy attributes positioned at the mid point between\\nexisting values are some of them. These can now be used for various purposes in Petrel.\\nIn the Operations Tab, it is possible to extract surface-consistent interval velocity points between\\na top and a bottom layer. These scatter values can then be edited, visualized and mapped to\\nderive Interval velocity maps. The Interval velocity maps can be assigned in the Make velocity\\nmodel process to create a velocity model.\\nAlternatively, these points can be sampled into a 3D grid (see Creating a grid for velocity\\nmodeling) and further the velocity interpolated using data analysis and petrophysical modeling\\nprocesses.\\nOnce velocities have been created in the 3D grid, they can be used directly as input to the velocity\\nmodeling process or average maps created from the velocity properties settings and used as\\ninput.\\nZ vs t or Z vs V plots can be made directly from the stacking velocities in a function window.\\nA function can then be created to pass through these points and describe the relationship. If a\\nstraight line is used, then V and k will be reported on the function\\'s settings dialog on the\\n0\\nFunction tab.\\nHow to extract interval velocity points from stacking velocities for depth\\nconversion\\n1. Import the stacking velocities as points with attributes or any of the predefined formats.\\n2.

Sample the points into the grid using the Scale up well logs process. Use Point attributes\\nas input in the process and select the Average velocity attribute for upscaling.\\n5. Interpolate the average velocity values using petrophysical modeling (and data analysis if\\nrequired).\\n6. Use the resulting average velocity property as input to velocity modeling.\\nCreating complex velocity functions\\nComplex velocity functions cannot be used directly in the Make velocity model dialog, but they\\ncan be used to create a velocity property within a 3D grid. This property can then be used in the\\ndepth conversion.\\nThere are a number of ways to create the property, the most obvious is sampling velocity data\\ninto the 3D grid and interpolate it using Petrophysical modeling. Here, the Data Analysis\\nmodule can be used to investigate trends (e.g. vertical increases in velocity) and ensure they are\\nhonored.\\nAlternatively, you can plot the velocity data in a function window, fit a function to the data and\\nthen use that in the calculator to create a smooth velocity property (see Functions and Using\\nFunctions and Surfaces in the Calculator).\\nHow to create complex velocity functions in make\\nvelocity model\\n1. Create a coarse time grid with the major time horizons using the Make simple grid process\\nand insert appropriate layering.\\n2. Plot any available data as time (x) versus velocity (y) in a function window.\\n3. Create a function using the button and fit it to the data (any number of additional\\npoints can be added).\\n4. Rename the function TimeVsVel .\\n5. In the property calculator write Velocity=TimeVsVel(Z) to create a velocity property and\\nmake sure that the property has the correct template.\\n6. Use the property as input to Make Velocity Model.\\nDepth converting thin layers\\nWhen the velocity model contains thin layers, the available velocity information for the layer may\\nbe sparse. In this case there are two options:\\n1. Ignore the layer - Choose one of the horizons (top or bottom) and use this as a zone\\nboundary. The layer will be converted as though it was part of the zone above or the zone\\nbelow. However, it will only be possible to perform well correction at the horizon in the\\nvelocity model.\\n2. Convert the layer together with the layer above or below - By using the Same as\\nabove option in the velocity model, either for the thin layer or the layer below it, the\\nvelocity for the thin layer and the well correction will be calculated together with the layer\\nabove or below it. This allows both the top and base of the thin layer to use well correction\\nwhile grouping the two layers together in terms of input data.\\nUsing a velocity cube with well correction\\nIf an extensive depth conversion study has been done outside Petrel, then it may be desirable to\\nuse a velocity or time/depth cube as input to the velocity model. If additional well data has\\nbecome available since the original study was done, then it can be useful to use well correction at\\nthe same time as this cube.\\nWell correction can only be used if there is an associated time surface in the velocity model.\\nHow to do well correction when creating a velocity model from a velocity\\ncube\\n1. Convert the seismic cube into an average velocity cube using the attribute generation\\nprocess if required.\\n2. Create the zones of the velocity model using the relevant time horizons for the well tops\\nwhere the correction should be performed.\\n3. Drop in the well tops at the correct depth.\\n4. Choose velocity cube as the velocity input and drop the average velocity cube into each\\nzone in the model.\\nUsing velocity models for stretching or\\nsqueezing seismic\\nEven if the seismic is in the same domain as the 3D grid or other seismic volumes, they may not\\nmatch exactly due to well corrections or resampling around the faults. If the seismic is to be\\nsampled into the grid, or two volumes compared, then they need to match exactly. This can be\\ndone by using a domain conversion in the velocity modeling process.\\nCreate a surface based on notable horizons in the seismic and create the same surface from the\\n3D grid or from the second seismic cube. Use these surfaces (from the seismic cube to be shifted)\\nto define the velocity model and choose Surface as the correction in the dialog. For the velocity\\ndata choose Correction - Surface.

Even if the same velocity model is used to depth convert and then backward time\\nconvert the seismic (for example, a 3D volume), both the sample rate and the time range can\\ndiffer from the original seismic to the roundtripped version of the same data. When converting\\nfrom time to depth, the constant datums representing the top and bottom of the cube becomes\\nsurfaces that varies with XY in the resulting cube. The depth cube gets its constant top/bottom\\ndatums as the extrema of the depth converted time datums. The area between the real depth\\nconverted datum and the constant used as extreme is padded with zeros (null values). When\\nconverting back to time, the padded samples are converted too, and the resulting time cube will,\\nafter the roundtrip have a wider timerange than the time cube used as starting point for the\\nroundtrip. An additional side effect is that since depth conversion in Petrel keeps the number of\\nsamples from the inpt cube, the sample rate increases.\\n3D Grid depth conversion\\n3D grids are depth converted by using the 3D grid depth conversion process under Structural\\nmodeling.\\nBefore you open the process, you should ensure the correct grid is active, as it is that grid which\\nwill be depth converted. By default, the conversion will create a new grid in depth. However, if\\nrequired, it can be used to overwrite another grid (horizon and property information will be\\nretained, if possible, so that these can be recreated) or overwrite the time grid.\\nThe velocity model to be used must be chosen and the direction of the conversion will be\\nestimated from that. If the grid is being converted back to time so that it can be rebuilt using\\nMake horizons etc., then you can choose to only convert the model pillars to save time. All the\\ndata in the grid will be lost, but the settings used to create it will be retained.\\nPillar geometry tab (Depth Conversion)\\nThe menu is identical to the Pillar geometry tab in Pillar gridding. The menu specifies how the\\nshape of the new depth converted pillars will be and how this should be done.

Is this structurally feasible?\\nDoes each minor fault have a solid intersection with its major fault? Does this fault-fault\\nintersection continue deeper into the earth model where it should? If this intersection breaks\\ndown with depth, horizons modeled at those levels will show the two faults disconnected (not\\nbifurcated). This may be okay if it reflects reality.\\nAre faults modeled to their true X,Y and Z extent within the model VOI? Sometimes faults are not\\nfully interpreted, leading to faults not modeled deep or shallow enough. Incomplete fault models\\ncan lead to degraded horizon models.\\nDo faults extend beyond where they truly exist? Make sure any extrapolation is reasonable.\\nStarting out it is prudent to consider excluding some of your faults. For the ones you do model, make\\nsure they honor the input data and make geological sense. Often, it adds to overall modeling efficiency\\nto start out with the more important faults (the ones with large vertical throw) and subsequently add\\nsubordinate faults (usually ones with smaller throw).

Fault model from structural framework places geophysical\\ninterpretation at the core of good model building by fully integrating with the seismic\\ninterpretation tool set. This allows users to\\nGet it right the first time - Asset teams fix modeling problems in the context of seismic\\ndata.\\nDirect link between geophysical interpretation and geocellular modeling.\\n\\'On the fly\\' approach to fault relationships, horizons and model construction.\\nImproved QC speed and functionality.\\nQuick validation of varied seismic interpretation within the \\'Petrel Unified Environment\\'.\\nOften geophysical interpretations are incompatible with geocellular modeling constraints and\\nsubsequently, due to modeling limitations, interpretation needs to be edited to build a coherent\\ngeocellular model.

Fault\\nframework while interpreting fully-integrates geophysical interpretation as part of the core\\nstructural framework construction process.

Before Petrel 2010, it was\\nknown as Structural Modeling\\nCorner point gridding in Petrel is subdivided into three processes:\\n1. Fault Modeling - defining the faults in the geological model which will form the basis for\\ngenerating the 3D grid. These faults will define breaks in the grid, lines along which the\\nhorizons inserted later may be offset. The offset which occurs is entirely dependant upon\\nthe input data, so modeling reverse faults is just as easy as modeling normal faults.\\n2. Pillar Gridding - generating the grid from the fault model. Limits on the geometry or the\\ngrid can be defined during the process so it is easy to generate two grids from the same\\nfault model - one designed for geological modeling and another optimized for simulation.\\n3. Make Horizons - building the vertical layering in the model, it is here that the offset on\\nthe faults is defined. Make Horizons generates independent geological horizons from XYZ\\ninput data, to generate additional horizons using relative distance to existing horizons (e.g.\\nisochores) use Make Zones. These two processes are used to create the geological zones\\nwithin the model. It is expected that each zone will have similar petrophysical properties\\nand can therefore be modeled using a single set of input data. Layering inserts the fine\\nscale grid cells which will describe vertical variation within each geological zone.\\nThese three processes should always be considered together and the user will normally go back\\nand forth between them. Problems with the fault model will often not be obvious before you begin\\nPillar Gridding, and problems with the pillar grid may not be obvious before you build your\\nhorizons in Make Horizons. Similarly, many problems identified when using Make Horizons will\\nrequire an edit of the pillar gridding options or even the fault model.\\nIt is recommended that you build the model simply at first and go right through these three\\nprocesses before progressively adding more complexity to the fault model. This will help you\\nidentify which features cause problems and how best to solve them.\\nWhat happens to the pillars during the corner\\npoint gridding'},\n",

The skeleton is a grid consisting of a\\nTop, a Mid and a Base skeleton grid (See figure a below), each attached to the Top, the Mid and\\nthe Base points of the Key Pillars (the fault model).\\nIn addition to the three skeleton grids, there are pillars connecting every corner point of every\\ngrid cell to their corresponding corners on the adjacent skeleton grid(s).\\nWhen creating your skeleton grid you will work with the Mid Skeleton grid. The Mid Skeleton grid\\nis the grid attached to the mid-lines that connect the Key Pillars. The purpose is to create a grid\\nthat looks OK at the midpoint level, with respect to the grid cell size, orientation and appearance\\nof the cells. The next step is to extrapolate this Mid Skeleton grid upwards and downward in order\\nto create the Top and Base skeletons. The result of the Pillar gridding has to be checked for\\ncrossing pillars, and the intersections (shown in the figure b below) are the most efficient tool for\\nQC.

What you can do to make Pillar Gridding quicker and more successful, allowing you to build\\nmore complex models\\n3. What situations will cause problems when Pillar Gridding.\\nFault modeling, Pillar Gridding and Building Horizons in the grid should be considered as one stage\\nin the model building process. Pillar Gridding is heavily dependant upon a high quality fault model\\nand many of the problems that can occur in the pillar gridding stage are not apparent until\\nhorizons are built within the grid.'},\n",
       " {'header': 'Structural Modeling - Basic Theory ',\n",
       "  'content': \"This section introduces the basic theory of structural modeling in Petrel. The method for building a\\n3D grid in Petrel is quite unique, and having a good knowledge of what actually happens will help\\nyou to recognize problems and understand why they occur.\\n2D and 3D grids\\nA grid is simply a way of storing XYZ locations which describe a surface.\\nIn a 2D regular grid you can do this by giving the elevation of the surface at regular intervals in X\\nand Y. If you imagine two surfaces stored in the same grid, the XY location of each node will be\\nidentical and only the Z coordinate will be different. Petrel's surface objects are examples of 2D\\ngrids.\\nIn Petrel, the fault model is used to define where these curved pillars should be and what shape\\nthey should have. Accordingly, reverse faults can easily be modeled and grid cells will match the\\nedge of the faults.\\nDefining the grid vertically\\nAs described above, the pillars of a 3D grid can be curved in the vertical direction. It is therefore\\nimportant to specify the top and bottom of each pillar. In a 2D grid, all of the pillars are parallel\\nand will never cross at any point. However, in a 3D grid, if we extend all the pillars vertically\\nfollowing the same curve, at some point they will begin to cross. The grid is therefore only useful\\nwithin a certain depth interval. If this coincides with where your model is there are no problems, if\\nnot, you will get negative cells.\\nThe best way to prevent this is to ensure that your fault model covers the whole vertical distance\\nfrom your lowest modeled horizon to your highest. That way you can QC your grid before you\\nbuild your horizons. If you have horizons above or below your fault model, add them to the model\\nin the Make Horizons process, the existing pillars will be extended until they meet these new\\nhorizons. Thus, an initially perfect grid may become twisted after Make Horizons .\\nThis is one of the reasons why it is important to also QC the pillar grid after the Make Horizons\\nand Make Zones processes.\\nHow faults are incorporated into the grid?\\nIn general, it is the shape points in a fault that are honored when you build the model grid and\\nnot the pillars. For example, although a pillar is curved, grid pillars at the same location in the grid\\nwill not necessarily have the same shape.\\nCurved pillars in the center of a fault are ignored in the 3D grid, although all the shape points are\\nhonored.\\nHowever, there are certain instances where the pillar is honored as well as the shape points:\\n1. At the end of a fault.\\n2. At the connection between two faults.\\n3. If there is a trend attached to the fault pillar.\\n2.\\n3.\\nCurved pillars at the end of a fault result in curved pillars in the 3D grid.\\nHow can I QC the grid?\\nThere are a number of tools for QCing the grid.\\n1. Examine the top, middle and bottom skeleton grids\\n2. Examine the pillars using I and J intersections\\n3. Build horizons in your model and display gridlines on the horizons\\n4. Insert horizons and layers (at a relatively fine scale) in your model, and use geometrical\\nmodeling to create a bulk volume property model, then check the statistics and filter on\\nnegative volumes to identify problem areas.\\nWhat should I look for?\\nPoints describing the geological horizons in your model can only be located along the pillars in the\\nmodel grid. It is desirable to have an even distribution of pillars, with enough pillars in all areas of\\nthe model to adequately describe the horizons in the model. If one area of the model has very\\nfew pillars, then the resolution of the horizon in this area will be limited.\\nGrid pillars, together with the model horizons and layers, form the cells for the property modeling\\nand volume calculation. It is important that the pillars do not cross as this will result in cells with\\nnegative volumes. Look for crossing grid lines in the skeleton grids and on horizons and crossing\\npillars in the grid intersections. This usually occurs at the end of steeply dipping faults, or faults\\nwith trends that contrast with the local grid direction.\\nHere a fault in the grid (which must be aligned with a grid line) cuts a grid intersection, indicating\\nnegative cells in the model.\\nWhat causes poor grids?\\nWhen you run pillar gridding, Petrel will first place pillars in the model to honor the faults and\\ntrends in the fault model. Once this is done, pillars will be placed between these defining pillars\\nthroughout the model. When placing these pillars, the aim is to have as smooth a transition as\\npossible, both in the pillar orientation and in pillar shape.\\nWhen building the fault model, try to imagine where Petrel is going to put the pillars and what\\nthey will look like. Try to avoid situations where the angle of pillars varies dramatically over a\\nshort distance, or where the pillars will be forced to diverge or converge. In both of these\\nsituations there is a much higher risk of pillars crossing (and therefore having negative cells) and\\nalso of having areas with few pillars and therefore poor resolution on the horizon.\\nIn some situations, complex geometries will be unavoidable. When these cases arise, pay\\nparticular attention when you QC the result. If the pillar gridding fails, it is highly probable that\\nthe problem is a result of complex geometries. If the model is too complex, try to increase the\\ndistance between the two key pillars that are creating the problems.\"},\n",

All of the pillars on the truncated area of the fault must have a corresponding pillar on the\\ntruncating fault, and vice versa.\\n2. The truncated fault must have a trend, although that trend could change from I to J if the\\ntruncation bends.\\nWhat happens in the grid?\\nWhen faults are truncated in the fault model, the pillars in the 3D grid will also be truncated. Inside\\nand adjacent to the truncation, the pillars will follow the plane of the truncating fault and truncate\\nagainst it. On the opposite side of the truncating fault, the pillars will be parallel to the truncating\\nfault.\\nFig. 1 A grid intersection through a truncated fault\\nPetrel's 3D grid is made up of rows and columns and, thus, truncated pillars cannot simply disappear.\\nInstead, they follow the line of the truncating fault until the end of the truncation, where they will fan\\nout into the grid again. These converging grid cells are a natural consequence of having a truncated\\nfault in the grid and need not be a problem. However, these are areas of sharp changes in the pillar\\nangles, and in more complex situations (that is, with steeply dipping faults or other truncations\\nnearby) problems might occur - look out for it when you QC the grid.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Key points when gridding truncations\\nPillars on the truncated fault should be kept as parallel as possible to each other and as perpendicular\\nas possible to the truncating fault. Changes in angle along the fault should be as smooth as possible\\nto make gridding as easy as possible. Simple models will often work without this, but when the faults\\nare steep, the structure complex, and trends are involved, this is essential.\\nWith double truncations, it is important to keep the pillars for both truncations and the truncated\\npillar aligned. The easiest way to do this is to edit the fault shape points in 3D while looking at the\\nsame faults in a 2D view. When the yellow arrows marking the two truncations are aligned, the pillars\\nare aligned.\\nIt is often useful to have trends on the truncated pillar and you might also need to specify the\\nnumber of cells on the trend to ensure that there are sufficient cells inside the truncation. As a\\ngeneral rule, the height of the shape points should be smooth. This is important for the mid shape\\npoint, since it is used to create the mid point skeleton grid which forms the basis for the 3D grid.\\nTruncations to make gridding easier\\nAs a general rule, it is best to avoid truncating faults; however, in some situations it can make the\\ngridding process easier. The transition across the end of a truncation is often a problem area as the\\nangle of the grid pillars changes rapidly in a short distance. If a fault has truncations at intervals\\nalong its length then it may be preferable to have at least one truncation along its whole length to\\nreduce the occurrence of these problematic areas.\\nFig. 8 A gap in the truncation means that pillars revert to passing straight through the grid.

This caould be because the truncation has joined the truncating fault or has\\nintersected a crossing fault.\\nIn the case below, the truncation is joined to the fault it was truncated by. This is done by first joining\\nthe two faults, then truncating the pillar where the joining occurs. As both the truncation and the\\ntruncating fault have a trend, a small section of the truncation must be given an arbitrary direction\\n(joining faults cannot have the same trend).\\nWith a more abrupt closure, or in cases where it is not possible to give a section of the truncating\\nfault an arbitrary direction, a second pillar can be added to the end of the truncation. The procedure\\nis identical to that described above; however, the truncation is joined to the same truncating pillar as\\nthe last truncation, rather than the adjacent pillar. In the pillar gridding process, the last section of\\nthe truncated fault is now given an opposite trend to those of the rest of the truncated fault, and all\\nof the columns in the model remain on the same side of the truncating fault.\\nIn cases where the truncation joins a second truncation with the truncating fault, the joining against\\nthe second truncation must be done this way.\\nIf the truncation ends against a crossing fault, the truncation is performed in much the same way.\\nFirst, connect the truncation to the crossing fault, and then truncate the pillar where the joining\\noccurs to the truncating fault.\\nIt might be necessary to move the adjacent pillar on the crossing fault closer to the truncating fault\\nto ensure the fault shape is honored correctly. Nevertheless, this is not essential. In certain\\nsituations, particularly if the truncating fault is steeply dipping, you may wish to truncate additional\\npillars on the crossing fault (see the figure below).\\nThe truncation is handled in much the same way as when the crossing fault also cuts the truncated\\nfault.

Before deciding to truncate two faults, check that the\\nlowest/highest horizon in the grid will be below/above the truncated points. If not, a truncation might\\nnot be the appropriate way to go.\\nAs with connecting faults, it is important to prepare truncations properly. Use the editing functions in\\nPetrel to move the truncating pairs of Key Pillars as closely into position as possible - that way you\\navoid surprises in the truncating process.\\nExample : In this figure there are a few problems, the largest being that the number of truncating Key\\nPillars does not match between the first and the last one!\\nNot very well prepared for truncating.\\nThe other problem is that several of the Key Pillars pairs are not close enough for the user to be sure\\nwhat will happen when the Key Pillars are truncated.\\nThis other figure shows how well the Key Pillar pairs that are to be truncated should be matched up\\nbefore the actual truncation!\\nReady for truncation!\\nNote how little space there is for any surprise movements of the Key Pillars when they are truncated.\\nConclusion : Use the input data available to model how the truncation should be before actually\\nexecuting the truncation.

It is not necessary to digitize them in a sequential order; the Key Pillar will be\\nplaced on the fault plane where you put them, next to the last one or between two of them.\\n5. Always deselect the last fault by clicking once on it before making a new fault.\\nIf the Add New Pillar by Two Points tool is used instead and the top and bottom point is\\ndigitized only, listric and curved Key Pillars will try and follow the fault surface as accurately as\\npossible.\\nAn alternative way of creating Key Pillars from fault surfaces can be to convert the surfaces to\\nlines. After this has been done, the polygons or lines can be used as input for creating the Key\\nPillars. This can sometimes be a quicker method.\\nHow to convert fault surfaces to polygons\\n1. Click with the right mouse button on the fault surface icon in the Input pane.\\n2. Select Convert to polygons. The lines will have the same name as the fault, but with a\\ndifferent icon. These lines can now be used as fault polygons or fault sticks.\\nThe result of the Convert to polygons operation depends on the gridding of the original data.\\nKey Pillars from Interpreted Seismic\\nInterpreted seismic lines can be used, in the same way as structural surfaces, to define the Key\\nPillars. The geophysicists normally leave a gap in the interpretation where there is a fault. These\\ngaps could be defining the hanging wall line and the footwall line for the fault.\\nGenerating Key Pillars from seismic interpretation.\\nHow to create faults from 3D seismic interpretation lines\\n1. Display the seismic top surface (faulted).\\n2. Click on the Map View Position icon and then on the Orthogonal On/Off icon to\\n\"remove\" the 3D perspective (this is only a visual effect).\\n3. Note that the Magnify icon becomes active. Click on this and use it to select an area in\\nwhich the fault is located. Do not rotate the image!\\n4. Open the Settings window for the seismic surface and tick the Show: points option. Resize\\nthe box shape if necessary.\\n5. Select the Add New Pillar by One Point tool.\\n6. Select Vertical, Linear , Listric or Curved Pillar.\\n7. Digitize the top of your Key Pillars by clicking on the end points of the seismic lines. Note\\nthat the Key Pillars are only there to define the shape of the fault, i.e. do not digitize them\\ntoo densely.\\n8. If needed, move the seismic surface by using Shift+left mouse button (pan).\\n9. When satisfied with the top of that fault, turn off the seismic top surface and display the\\nseismic base surface instead.\\n10. Digitize the base of the Key Pillars using the Snap Selected Shape Point . Always\\ndeselect the last fault by clicking once on it before making a new fault.\\nKey Pillars from an Intersection\\nTo easily include faults that are only slightly offset, Petrel has the option to digitize faults on an\\nintersection plane.\\nTo create an intersection plane, right-click on the folder with, for example, input surfaces (you\\ncan also use folders for other data types such as seismic lines, fault polygons, etc.) and select\\nInsert General Intersection from the menu. For more details about the General Intersection,\\nsee General Intersection. Use the tools for the General Intersection that appear in the Function\\nbar below the Display window. Note that the intersection plane is transparent by default. Click on\\nthe Toggle Visualization on Plane (shortcut key Ctrl+B) icon situated at the left side of\\nthe Function bar. When this icon is active, most input data files (those getting a blue filling in their\\ncheck box in front of the name) can be displayed on the intersection. To display such an object\\noutside the intersection, toggle the Toggle Visualization on Plane icon off.\\nIt is important to remember that we are now talking about different display modes, not changes\\nin the actual data. Only use this \"blue-box\" functionality for intersection view display.\\nTo view both of the lines on the intersection and the item, turn on the item before you click on the\\nToggle Visualization on Plane icon and then turn it on again when the Toggle Visualization\\non Plane is active. Use the Clip in front icon to hide data in front of the plane.\\nTo clip the fault model as well, use the Toggle Clipping by Plane together with the clip\\nin front/behind tools.\\nAn example showing Key Pillars digitized on an intersection.\\nHow to make Key Pillars from an Intersection\\n1.

Activate the intersection plane by clicking on the Manipulate Plane icon.\\n6. Move the plane to the beginning of the fault you want to digitize. Drag it forwards and\\nbackwards with the cursor (in Select/Pick Mode ) or use the right and left arrow keys.\\nTo rotate the plane around its own axis, press the Shift key while moving the cursor.\\n7.\\n8.\\n6.\\n7. Select Vertical, Linear , Listric or Curved Pillar.\\n8. Digitize the Key Pillars by using the Add new pillar icon. First, click on the icon, and\\nthen digitize points, Key Pillar by Key Pillar, by clicking on the plane. The number of points\\nto digitize per Key Pillar depends on the type selected in step 7.\\n9. Select the Manipulate Plane icon again and move the Intersection Plane away from\\nyou to where you want the next Key Pillar to be. Continue until the fault is completed. The\\nGeneral Intersection can also be moved using the Page Up and Page Down keys on the\\nKeyboard. To rotate the plane, use the left arrow and right arrow keys.\\nBuilding your fault model directly on a seismic intersection is an excellent way of interpreting\\nfaults. The interpreter will then spot connecting faults early on and can decide on the type of\\nconnection required, avoiding the need for a \\'reinterpretation\\' fault sticks or polygons later on.\\nKey Pillars from fault sticks\\nFault sticks can be used like fault polygons to create Key Pillars. Fault sticks are sets of line data\\nthat represent the fault plane. The file with fault sticks can represent one fault or a set of faults.\\nFault sticks seen in a 3D window.\\nKey Pillars are auto-generated from the fault sticks, either from all the fault sticks in one file, or\\nfrom selected fault sticks.\\nHow to make Key Pillars from fault sticks\\n1. Display the fault sticks in Petrel Explorer.\\n2. Select Vertical, Linear , Listric or Curved Pillar. All the Key Pillars of the\\nfault will be of the same type when created, but that can be changed after generation.\\n3. In a file with several faults, select the fault sticks in the fault that you want to create the\\nKey Pillars from and then click on the Add to or create fault from selected fault sticks\\nicon.\\n4. In a folder with only one fault, click on the Create fault from fault sticks, surface or\\ninterpretation icon without selecting any fault sticks first.\\n5. A dialog, Convert to Pillar Faults, will pop up.\\n6. In the dialog, set the number of fault sticks to skip. A Key Pillar will be generated for every\\nnth fault stick.\\n7. Set the default height and the extra height. The extra height will be added above and below\\nthe fault sticks to ensure that the fault is defined throughout the model.\\n8. Click OK, and a fault is created on the basis of the fault sticks.\\n8.\\nEditing Key Pillars in 3D\\nAfter you have created a fault you may want to do some fine-tuning on a specific Key Pillar or on\\nthe whole fault. Petrel has the option to either edit single Shape Points or pillars, as well as a\\nselection of Shape Points or pillars. To select more than one, press the Shift key as you make\\nyour selection.\\nRemember that an active fault is always drawn with white lines between the Key Pillars. Some\\nediting features (such as digitizing new Key Pillars or truncating) will affect the active fault.\\nHow to edit a single Shape Point\\n1. Make sure the Select Shape Point tool is active.\\n2.

       "  'content': 'Geological vs. simulation grid\\nPreserving small features from well logs and seismic data is significant for a geological grid. These\\ngrids are designed to preserve the heterogeneity of the reservoir by typically subdividing it on a\\nfine scale vertically, as well as keeping the XY-representation of the grid cells as small as possible.\\nA geological grid often has millions of cells. Volume calculations are important in this type of grid\\nand that is also why we try to honor the faults during the 3D gridding process by choosing the\\nmost appropriate fault geometries.\\nThe simulation grid must have grid cell geometries which conform to the requirements of the\\nspecific flow simulator used. Using zigzag type faults is one option to keep the grid cells as\\northogonal as possible. The size of the simulation grid is commonly around 50,000 cells,\\ndepending on the flow simulator and the hardware used for the simulation. Going from a\\ngeological grid to a simulation grid requires a more or less radical homogenization of property\\nvalues, which also needs to be taken into account. Fault geometries may also require\\nsimplification.\\nBefore starting with the Pillar Gridding\\nThere are some things that we recommended you check before you start with the Pillar Gridding\\nprocess:\\nAre there any crossing faults that are not properly connected\" Check (in the 3D window) for\\nfaults that have a crossing path and for faults that meet - do they have a shared (gray\\ncolored) Key Pillar? If not - use the Connect Two Faults tool in the Fault Modeling\\nprocess to connect them. (see figure below.)\\nTwo faults not properly connected (left) vs. correctly connected pillars (right), note the grey\\nconnecting pillar.\\nDoes any Key Pillar extend beneath another in Z? See the figure below for an example.\\nCheck in a 3D window - it may not be obvious in 2D as only the Mid Shape Points are\\ndisplayed here. If there is a problem, go back to Fault Modeling and edit the Key Pillars\\ninvolved until there is no overlap anywhere. A truncation may be the correct solution to the\\nproblem in some cases, see Vertically Truncated Faults for details.\\nKey Pillar extending beneath another in Z (viewed from above).\\nDo all of the Key Pillars extend above and below the top and base of the final top and base\\nof the model. If they do not, they will be automatically extended by Petrel during the Make\\nhorizon or Make zones processes. If the original pillars converge, then this extension can\\nresult in pillars that cross each other as described above. Remember that the Key Pillars are\\nthere to define the slope and shape of the faults only, not their vertical extension, so don\\'t\\nworry about extending dying out faults above their true extension. The one exception to this\\nrule is truncated faults.\\nAre all transitions between neighboring Key Pillars smooth? If not, go back to Fault Modeling\\nand correct this. Radical differences in vertical extension of neighboring Key Pillars will\\nimpede the gridding algorithms.\\nIs the Z-extension reasonably similar to all Key Pillars - relative to the top and base\\nreference? If not, go back to Fault Modeling and correct it. The smoother the total\\nimpression of the fault model is, the greater the probability of the grid becoming smooth\\nand of high quality.\\nTruncated faults have a number of additional requirements, see Gridding of Truncations.\\nGeneral workflow in Pillar Gridding\\nIt is important to keep the future 3D model in mind when working on the grid layout. Try to keep\\nthe skeleton grid cells as orthogonal as possible. A good rule is to start simple and then add\\ndetails to generate a more complex grid, one step at a time\\nThe complete workflow in the Pillar Gridding process comprises a series of important steps:\\n1. Double-click on Pillar Gridding in the Process diagram. The Pillar Gridding process\\ndialog will open up. A 2D window will automatically open and display your fault model in a\\nmap view.\\n2. Rename the 3D grid in the Settings tab. Move the process dialog aside (or close it) for\\nbetter view of the 2D window.\\n3. Build your boundary around the area of interest (for instance, display an input surface to\\ncheck the area of interest).\\n4. Open the process dialog and check the various settings under the different tabs (optional)\\nbefore going to the Execute tab and clicking Apply to generate the 2D grid.\\n5. If required, two perpendicular fault directions (I and J) can be defined within the grid.\\nAssign I- and J-directions to faults, and parts of faults, that follow these directions\\nrespectively. Run the gridding process again to find out where the grid needs more work.\\n6. Add trends to further improve the grid. Run the grid to check how well the trends work. Edit\\nif needed and run again.\\n7. When you are satisfied with the 2D grid, click OK to generate the 3D grid. If there are\\nproblems that cannot be solved with directions and trends go back and edit on the Key\\nPillars in the Fault Modeling process step.\\nIt is a good idea to go through the 2D gridding several times with different selections of directions\\nand trends before generating the 3D grid. The program will allow you to quickly rebuild the XY\\ngrid as many times as you wish.\\nPillar Gridding process dialog, the Settings tab.\\nSometimes a pop-up dialog will appear with the message Can not incorporate ... Continue\\nanyway\" - This message is telling you that there is something in the settings that the program\\ncannot solve mathematically.\\nIf you answer Yes to the question, the gridding will continue and color the affected points on the\\ngrid when finished. A No answer will stop the gridding process and color the affected points.\\nSome of the common reasons for this message appearing are:\\nA trend crossing a fault - this is not allowed.\\nA trend set in conflict with a fault defined as I- or J-direction\\nTriple points: Are there more than two faults and/or trends originating from one point\"\\nTwo faults at exactly 45degrees angles - solve this with trends.'},\n",

A trend should not be digitized across a fault. When starting or terminating a trend on\\na fault, it needs to be connected to a Key Pillar on the fault. You can start/stop a trend in the\\nmiddle of the grid, or snap it to an existing Key Pillar by digitizing on the Key Pillar.

The Fault will then be\\ntreated as a 3D trend in the gridding process and not incorporated as a fault in the generated 3D\\ngrid. A fault that is set to no fault will be drawn with a stippled line.\\nSet Number of Cells on Connection - Define how many cells should be between the end\\npoints of a trend or a part of a fault.\\nLock/Unlock Virtual Translation - If activated, you are allowed to move (virtually) nodes\\non faults. Used to fix difficult gridding situations. This is an expert function and should be used\\nwith care. See Virtual Translation.\\nUndo Virtual Translation - Will undo a previous virtual translation.

Fault\\npillars can sometimes be very close to each other without being connected, connected\\npillars are grey.\\nDoes your grid have trends that contradict each other? Faults and trends assigned to the\\nsame direction (either I or J) should be roughly parallel to each other and roughly\\nperpendicular to opposite trends.\\nAre the chosen pillar geometries appropriate? Allowing curved faulted pillars but only\\nstraight non-faulted pillars could result in negative cells close to the fault, especially if the\\nfaults are strongly listric.\\nIs the tolerance distance appropriate? (see the pillar geometry tab in pillar gridding) This is\\nthe distance Petrel uses to decide which type of pillar is appropriate. A good rule of thumb is\\nto use a distance that is 10% of the initial grid spacing.\\nIs Shape Point Resampling turned on? (Pillar gridding dialog, pillar geometry tab). This\\nwill help Petrel make the smoothest possible grid.\\nIf you are modeling truncated faults, have the faults been given a trend? Are the\\ntruncation\\'s pillars roughly 90 degrees to the truncating fault in 2D\"\\nHow to optimize the fault model for Pillar Gridding\\nGenerally speaking, Petrel assumes that faults go in a straight line. While curving faults\\npose no problem to the gridding process, it can sometimes be wise to replace a single fault\\nwith a 90degrees bend, with two faults connected at the bend.\\nIf areas of the grid have large cells it can be because there are diverging or converging\\nfaults with fixed trends. Remember, it is possible to remove trends from sections of faults.\\nIf the problem persists, use arbitrary trends across the section (choose the same direction\\nas that made without the trend) and specify the number of grid cells.\\nIf there are a number of trends in the grid with a specified number of grid cells, or the\\ntrends cause large changes in the size of the grid cells, it may be necessary to increase the\\nnumber of cells in the model.

When introducing the horizons to the set of pillars generated in the Pillar\\nGridding process, all intersections between the pillars and the horizons become nodes in the 3D\\ngrid.\\nGeneral overview of Make Horizons\\nThe 3D grid will have as many main layers as number of horizons inserted into the set of pillars.\\nIn the Petrel Explorer this is shown as Horizons in the Models window.\\nThis is a true 3D approach in the generation of 2D surfaces; all are gridded in the same process,\\ntaking the relationships between the surfaces into account (erosion, on-lap, etc), honoring the\\nfault model to ensure proper fault definitions in the surfaces and keeping the well control (well\\ntops).\\nFor the faulted areas, the horizons are blanked (deleted) in a user given area around the faults\\nand an extrapolation is performed to \"stretch\" the surface back onto the fault plane. This will\\nensure that rollovers or pull-ups near faults are eliminated and a high quality layering of the 3D\\ngrid is preserved.\\nIt should be noted that the skeleton grids are modified if the top and/or base of the input data\\nextend above or below the Top and/or Base Shape Points respectively. The Key Pillars should\\nextend above top horizon and below base horizon. If you have horizons above or below your fault\\nmodel and add them to the model in Make Horizons, the existing pillars will be extended until\\nthey meet these new horizons, and in some cases it can cause the pillars to cross.

Negative volumes can be present in Petrel when the grid has been build on a\\npoor fault model or with poorly defined directions and trends in the gridding process. The most\\ncommon cause of negative volumes in Petrel is faults that cross each other without being\\nconnected or truncated.\\nAfter the Make Horizon process it is important to check for negative volumes before doing more\\nwork on the model.

The Layering process\\nenables the user to define the final vertical resolution of the grid by setting the cell thickness or\\nthe number of desired cell layers.\\nStatus difference between zones and layering\\nWhen creating zones in Petrel each zone will be defined by two horizons.

The\\nsimulation results (which are only produced for the coarse model) are automatically expanded\\nback onto the fine grid for visualization).\\nThere may be many reasons why all of the proposed cells cannot be joined into a single\\nrepresentative one. For example some of them have no defined geometry, or they conflict with\\nother LGRs whose host cells take a higher priority. The resulting geometry of the amalgamation\\nmay look far from rectangular. This does NOT concern the simulator and does not imply that we\\nare using a new type of unstructured grid. The 3D view of the coarsened grid block is a\\nrepresentation only. The pore volume of the coarse block will be the sum of the individual cell\\npore volumes. The transmissibility between coarse blocks or from coarse to fine does NOT use the\\ncell face geometry of the coarse block, ECLIPSE performs a Transmissibility Upscaling of the fine\\nscale Transmissibilities calculated on the fine model.\\nCoarsen Outside without Active Filter\\nFigure 1.

       "  'content': \"Property modeling is the process of filling the cells of the grid with discrete (facies) or continuous\\n(petrophysics) properties. Petrel assumes that the layer geometry given to the grid follows the\\ngeological layering in the model area. Thus, are these processes dependant on the geometry of\\nthe existing grid. When interpolating between data points, Petrel will propagate property values\\nalong the grid layers.\\nProperty modeling in Petrel is split into three separate processes:\\nGeometrical modeling - No interpolation of input data is required. Properties are built\\nbased on the geometrical properties of the grid cells themselves, such as a cell volume,\\nangle, height, etc. Some algorithms also require input data, but this data is simply sampled\\ninto the grid (e.g. seismic).\\nFacies modeling - Interpolation or simulation of discrete data, for example, facies.\\nPetrophysical modeling - Interpolation or simulation of continuous data, for example,\\nporosity, permeability, and saturation.\\nIn addition there are other process steps which can be used when modeling properties:\\nScale up well logs - The process of sampling values from well logs or well log attributes\\ninto the grid, ready for use as input to facies modeling and petrophysical modeling.\\nData analysis - The process of preparing the input data (normally upscaled well logs) for\\nproperty modeling. It involves applying transformations on input data, identifying trends for\\ncontinuous data, vertical proportion, and probability for discrete data. It also involves\\ndefining variograms that describe the input for both cases. This is then used in the facies\\nand petrophysical modeling to ensure that the same trends appear in the result.\\nTrend modeling - This process allows you to produce a vertical proportion volume by\\nperforming a block kriging of the probabilities of each of the facies.\\nUser-defined object creation - The process enables you to model objects that are not\\nlimited in shape and can have an arbitrary 3D geometry defined by the user.\\nTraining image and pattern creation - A training image is an idealized and simplified\\nrepresentation of the reservoir geology. The information contained in the training image is\\nreorganized into conditional distribution information that is accessible by the simulation\\nalgorithm. The conditional distributions are stored in the form of a tree called a Multi-point\\nfacies pattern. A pattern means investigating the neighborhood relationship between the\\nfacies and writing it into a tree.\\nFault analysis - The process where you can generate fault transmissibility multipliers,\\neither directly or by modeling fault properties, providing grid permeabilities, and calculating\\nthe multiplier. These are then used as input to the simulation or simply as a visual\\nassessment of the sealing potential of faults.\\nTrain estimation model - This process gives you access to tools for Neural Network\\nanalysis, enabling you to create a classification or estimation model object.\\nGeneral information on Property modeling\\nThe objective of Property modeling is to distribute properties between the available wells so it\\nrealistically preserves the reservoir heterogeneity and matches the well data. The Data analysis\\nwill help to QC and interpret the data, to identify key geological features, and to prepare the input\\nfor Facies- and Petrophysical modeling.\\nThe input distribution of the data is honored during the modeling process, but there are often a\\nnumber of ways of interpreting the input data (for example, how much of the variation is due to\\ntrends and how much is 'random').\\nIf you imagine three points in a straight line with steadily ascending values, you may assume that\\nthis is a trend throughout your data. However, three points is a small amount, and it is possible\\nthat the data you sampled is much more varied and you randomly got the ascending values. If\\nyou sampled the data again, in the same areas, you might have the highest value in the middle or\\nat the opposite end. The difference is that if you assume that this is due to a trend when you\\ndistribute properties, they will have a smooth linear trend across the model. If you assume it is all\\nrandom, you will have random property values across the model.\\nIn the image below, the blue line shows that the apparent trend is that the data is random. As\\nillustrated by the red line, the data shows a real trend.\\nBasically, you identify trends in the Data analysis process and then use the Property modeling\\nprocesses to model the random variation away from that trend, that is, the deviation from the\\ntrends you have defined. It is important that you make a conscious decision on whether the trend\\nis real or not, ignoring it if you do not think it is genuine.\\nInstead of using your property values directly as input to the Property modeling process, the\\ntrend is accounted for by modeling the residual; that is, the difference between the property\\nvalues at each of the upscaled cells and the trend at that point. The residual is then added to the\\ntrend to give the model results. Petrel does this automatically when you use the Data analysis\\nprocess or insert 1D, 2D or 3D trends during the Petrophysical modeling process.\\nBefore we show you some practical examples of this, it is useful to look at the concept of\\nvariograms first.\\nUsing variograms in modeling\\nA variogram is a description of the variations in a property. It is based on the principle that two\\npoints close together are more likely to have similar values than points far away from each other.\\nThere are two main aspects to a variogram:\\n1. How similar are two values right next to each other (nugget)?\\n2. How far away do points have to be before they bear no relation to each other (range)?\\nIt is important to remember that the Property modeling processes are used to describe the\\nnatural (random) variation in a property. The variogram should describe this natural variation,\\nrather than the broad scale trends that you see in your data. Identify any regional trends in the\\nData analysis process before you start the variogram analysis (this is especially true when you\\nare using Sequential Gaussian simulation for modeling, which will introduce variation into your\\nproperty to honor the variogram).\\nDeterministic modeling\\nKriging is an estimation method. It estimates the distribution of the result at any single point;\\nhowever, it is deterministic because it returns the most likely result at that point (even when the\\nuncertainty is high).\\nIn the example below (Figure 1), the kriging estimation is based on five data points, four identical\\nones, and a high value in the middle. The first figure shows a property model with a high\\nvariogram range, the second has a much lower range. Due to the larger range in the first one, the\\nhigh value in the center increases the probability of having a high value at a greater distance from\\nthe center.\\nIn the second figure, a smaller range means that the best estimate becomes the mean (that is,\\nmaximum uncertainty) rather quickly as you move away from the known data points.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The range of a variogram can be diverse in different directions (and will often be very different in\\nthe vertical direction using vertical well log data as input). The Data analysis module allows you\\nto analyze your data in two directions; horizontally (these will be perpendicular to each other) and\\nvertically. All of this data can then be used in the Property modeling process.\\nIn the vertical direction, you often have continuous data along the well and can perform a\\nreasonable variogram analysis.\\nHorizontally, it is rare to have enough sample points to generate an ideal variogram, unless you\\nhave several lateral wells. Based on your knowledge of the area, estimate what kind of lateral\\nvariation you can expect and then use the variogram generation in the Data analysis process to\\ncheck that it fits with your data.\\nStochastic modeling\\nKriging will give you the value with the highest probability for each point. However, this will give\\nyou a smooth result and you cannot assume that this is the most likely distribution. It will reduce\\nhigh values and increase low values so that volumes calculated from kriged surfaces can have\\nsignificant errors, particularly when applying a cut off to differentiate pay from non-pay or in the\\nform of a contact for structure.\\nTo capture the variation you have identified in your data, using the variogram analysis, you need\\nto use a stochastic algorithm such as Sequential Gaussian simulation. This is essentially\\nsimilar to Kriging, but uses the variogram and the property distribution of the input data to add\\nadditional features to your property. Property models generated with the Sequential Gaussian\\nsimulation look more reasonable than those modeled using deterministic averaging methods and\\nthey honor the input distribution data more realistically.\\nThe disadvantage of this method is that it looks convincing and realistic even in areas far away\\nfrom the input data. The results should be viewed with great caution (do not drill high values) and\\nshould only be used if you are prepared to work with several realizations of the same model.\\nThe property models below (Figure 2 ) have the same input data and variograms as those above,\\nbut they are modeled using a Sequential Gaussian distribution. The random shapes are obviously\\ndifferent from the results of Kriging, but again you can see the influence of the variogram. A\\nlarger range (to the left) leads to larger areas of high and low values, and a low range results in\\nmuch more local variations. Note that in this case it is difficult to guess where the input data is,\\nbecause the model does not get artificial effects from the sample location. Conversely, several\\nrealizations with identical input data, but a different seed, would result in different models\\n(although the statistical distribution might be the same). This is especially true if you are working\\nwith sparse input data.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Use of seeds in Stochastic modeling\\nIn stochastic modeling it is desirable to produce many similar outcomes with the same\\nparameters (except for a \"seed\" value explained below) so that statistical inferences from the set\\nof all outcomes can be made. Conclusions drawn from a single stochastic outcome can be\\nincorrect. For example, if one particular outcome shows that two wells are connected by a\\nchannel, it is incorrect to assume that the wells necessarily must be connected by a channel in the\\nreal reservoir. If, however, after running many realizations, 60% of them show two wells\\nconnected by a channel, if all other assumptions are correct, then it is reasonable to assume that\\nthere is a 60% chance that the wells are connected in reality.\\nOutcomes with the same parameters differ in details that the user does not control directly. These\\ndetails are determined by the algorithm based on a series of pseudorandom numbers (i.e.\\nnumbers that appear to be random but are actually generated by a deterministic method)\\ngenerated from one seed value. Stochastic modeling dialogs allow you to either set this seed\\nvalue or to have it set randomly by the program. Setting the seed to a given value will always\\ncause the algorithm to use the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers. When generating\\nmany outcomes in order to draw statistical inferences, you should allow the seed to be set\\nrandomly by the program (that is, uncheck the box beside the seed value(s)) in order to obtain\\nmany outcomes that are statistically similar, but differ in their details.\\nA stochastic outcome should only have to be reproduced if you wish to show the details of one run\\nor if you are attempting to analyze or debug a potential problem. To exactly reproduce the same\\nresults in two separate stochastic modeling runs, you must ensure the following:\\n1. You must be using the same version of Petrel in both runs. If you applied a patch or changed\\nversions of Petrel from the last run, you will no longer be able to reproduce the exact same\\noutput.\\n2. The seed value(s) used must be the same.\\n3. All other input (including all properties, surfaces, options, parameters, or settings that\\nintervene in the modeling) must be identical. It is not sufficient for the input to be equivalent (for\\nexample, in object modeling, requesting 10 bodies may be equivalent to requesting 5% facies of\\nthat body for a particular run); the input must be identical in both runs to obtain the same result.\\n4. The output of the first run should not be used as input for the second run if it changes during\\nthe run. For example, in object modeling, if an output facies property is used as input background\\nproperty for the next run, the results will not be the same.\\nIt is often not possible to reproduce a stochastic outcome exactly when changing to a different\\nversion of Petrel. However, correct usage of stochastic modeling methods should preclude this\\nneed.\\nWhy use trends in Property modeling\\nWhat is the point of defining a trend? When you perform petrophysical modeling, trends in the\\ninput data appear in the result. So, why do you need to identify them first? The figure (Figure 3 )\\nbelow shows a classic example where, due to ambiguities in the data, identifying a trend before\\nperforming Property modeling makes a big difference.

It\\nis therefore important that you make sure the trend surface represents the property values you\\nexpect to see (i.e. a porosity trend surface should normally have values between 0 and 0.35).\\nWhy use Transformations in Property modeling\\nThe Sequential Gaussian simulation that Petrel uses in the Petreophysical modeling process\\nrequires the input data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Consequently, if the input data is not\\nstandard normally distributed, then the results will not be coherent with the input.\\nTransformations are used to map the original distribution to a standard normal distribution prior\\nto Property modeling and also to identify patterns in the data. Once the modeling has been\\ncompleted, the mapping (or transformation) is reversed to ensure the results have the same\\ndistribution as the input. This is done automatically in Petrel, as long as the transformation has\\nbeen applied during Data analysis. If no transformation has been applied, then Petrel will\\nautomatically perform a Normal Score transformation prior to modeling (see standard\\ndistributions and normal score transformations).'},\n",

For the upscaled\\nlog to be available, a discrete (facies) log must have been upscaled first. The reference of the raw\\nlog will appear in an upscaled form.\\nThis option is used to ensure that the upscaled values for a petrophysical property are appropriate\\nfor the facies property for the same cell.

With this option\\nit is possible to change the weight of a particular facies, or to adjust the proportion of the\\nupscaled log to the raw log. You can specify the settings to apply for all zones or specify separate\\nsettings for each individual zone.\\nBy default, all of the facies will have a value of 1 on the Weighted table. Setting the same values\\nfor all facies gives the same result as using the 'Most of' algorithm. Increasing the weight of a\\nparticular facies means that less of that facies is required for it to be assigned to the upscaled cell.\\nThe weight values are relative, so they can be assigned as fractions. No method exists to\\ndetermine a weighted value. It is a process of trial and error, but comparing the histogram for the\\nupscaled facies to the raw logs can help to determine when a weight value is adequate.\\nFor example, if you scale up a facies log containing sand and shale using weight 1 (one) for both\\nfacies codes, as a result, you will get twice as much shale as sand. If you then want to increase\\nthe amount of sand, you must increase the weight for that facies code until you reach the desired\\nfraction between the sand and shale.\\nHow to use the Weighted tab\\n1. First, upscale the facies or discrete log as usual.\\n2. Select Update existing property and your upscaled discrete log as Input.\\n3.

This window displays the proportion\\nof facies in one zone or all zones, depending on the selection you have made in the general\\nsettings. Above this window, there is a table with facies and the user can select which facies\\nto display in the facies proportion window. All facies are selected as default.

The user has the option to fit the probability curve to a linear regression curve, to\\noriginal histogram or to a constant average value\\n5. The sum of the probabilities equals 1 . Hence, by editing the probability curve for the\\nactive facies, you will proportionally change the other facies probability curves (the facies\\nprobability always equals 1)\\n6. When you have finished editing on a selected facies probability curve, you have the option\\nto freeze it by locking the selected curve . If a curve is frozen, it will not be affected\\nwhen other facies probability curves are changed\\n7. After the definition of the probability curves, the settings must be applied. If you are\\nworking with the zones separately, you apply the settings for all zones at the same time\\nwhen pressing Apply\\n8. The edited facies probability curves can now be used in the Facies modeling\\nThickness tab (Data analysis)\\nThis tab enables you to analyze the thickness of facies bodies by means of a histogram.\\nThe main window in the tab is the histogram window. In the table on the left side, you can select\\nwhich facies to display.\\nStatistical characteristics, such as % (percentage of samples), Cell count (number of cells), N\\n(samples number), Minimum , Maximum , Mean and Std (standard deviation), attached to the\\nfacies codes are displayed above the window. The first three parameters on the left indicate the\\npercentage of samples, the number of cells or log samples and number of facies intervals done in\\nthe selected facies code(s) and the selected interval.\\nThese figures should be used to estimate the required thickness of bodies for use in the Object\\nmodeling algorithm in Facies modeling.\\nThe facies thickness shown in Data analysis represents the vertical facies thickness at the\\nwell locations. It may not represent the full thickness of the facies bodies if the well is not drilled\\nat the center of the body. The thickness input for object facies modeling requires the full thickness\\nof the facies bodies. Therefore, the facies thickness input in object facies modeling should often be\\nhigher than the statistic numbers in Data analysis.\\nSettings for the Thickness tab (Data analysis)\\nThe interval width for the histogram can be set by changing the Bin Interval .\\nThe number N and percentage of samples % in the selected interval and the selected facies are\\nshown in the top left area.\\nShow simbox hieght - Toggles between real and simbox view.

Discrete properties, on the other, hand have integer values; for example, facies\\nproperties, where the \"value\" is either sand or shale represented by integers in Petrel (no decimal\\nvalues are possible).\\nThe Data analysis dialog on continuous properties includes two main tabs:\\n1. Transformations tab\\nViewing the data distribution as histograms, etc.\\nIdentifying trends within the data\\nMaking different data transformations such as Normal score, etc.\\nWhat is a Transformation?\\nA transformation is the preparation of a real data set into an internal data set that meets the\\nstatistical requirements given by a chosen algorithm (see Transformations available).\\nData transformation will make the data stationary and standard normally distributed before the\\nactual modeling process. Back-transformation will be automatically performed in the exact\\nreverse order of the modeling result to preserve the spatial trends and original data distribution in\\nthe final result property.\\nWhat is a Trend?\\nA trend is a permanent or continuous change of the mean value of a property in a 1D, 2D or 3D\\nmodel (see 1D Trend, 2D Trend and 3D Trend).\\nOnce trends have been identified, transformations can be used to extract them prior to\\nPetrophysical modeling. The Petrophysical modeling algorithm is then performed on the\\nresidual and after the modeling, the results will be back-transformed in a reversed order. This\\nensures that the same identified trends observed in the original data are also present in the\\nmodeled property.\\nSee Why use trends in property modeling and Why use transformations in property modeling for\\nmore details.\\nSee How to do Data Analysis on continuous variables? for detailed information in this process.\\n2. Variograms tab\\nDescribing the spatial variation of data by generating variograms (Horizontal and Vertical).\\nSee Variogram Analysis (Data Analysis)) for detailed information in this process.\\nNote that if you run through the Petrophysical modeling process without having gone\\nthrough the Data analysis process, the data will still be transformed by using the Normal Score\\ntransformation. By going through these steps in the Data analysis process, you can define the\\nentire transformation sequence interactively.\\nBackground on performing Transformations\\nThe two main objectives of the data transformation process are:\\n1.\\n2.\\n1. To remove spatial trends so that the data will be stationary, and\\n2. To transform the data into Standard normal distribution (with a mean of 0 and standard\\ndeviation of 1).\\nA stationary distribution is a basic requirement for input data to most geostatistical algorithms.\\nStandard normal distribution is a requirement of the Gslib Sequential Gaussian Simulation\\nalgorithm used for stochastic petrophysical simulation. The data must be transformed so that it\\nfits this criteria.\\nRemoving trends by identifying an appropriate transformation is an essential part of the Property\\nmodeling process. See Why use trends in property modeling and Why use transformations in\\nproperty modeling for more details.\\nTransformations are not commutative; that is, changing the order in which two\\ntransformations are applied will have a significant effect on the result. It is important to apply all\\nthe transformations in the right order. As guidance, the available transformations are listed in the\\norder they should be entered into the transformation sequence.\\nWhat can Transformations do for me?\\nData, such as porosity and permeability, will be distributed between the wells in Petrophysical\\nmodeling. The inputs are the well data and the modeler\\'s conceptual model of the geology. The\\nwell data must be considered together with the conceptual model, analyzed and possibly\\nmanipulated, in order to generate a 3D model that fits both the data and the conceptual model.\\nThe following are some examples:\\n1. Porosity shows a roughly normal distribution and a spatial trend (for example, decreasing\\ndown depositional gradient or vertically). Using transformations, this trend can be\\nidentified, removed for the purposes of property modeling and reapplied to the result of the\\nmodeling (this can be performed automatically in Petrel). The trend and the appropriate\\ndistribution will be preserved in the resulting model.\\n2. Data for the particular zone is sparse and perhaps not statistically valid, but supplementary\\ndata gives a lot of confidence in the conceptual model. You can control the modeling by\\nspecifying a porosity distribution that is normally distributed, with a specified mean and\\nstandard deviation (If you want to use a trend, the trend has to be specified before the\\ndistribution. In other words, you can only specify the distribution for the residual) to give a\\nmore realistic model than merely extrapolating from the available data.\\n3. When displaying the histogram of the porosity within clean sand, you might observe some\\nvery low porosity values that indicate that they are outliers. By using the Truncate\\nObservations transformation, these outliers can be truncated and not be considered in the\\nfinal realization.'},\n",

Normally distributed data\\nwill have something like a \"bell curve\" shape.\\nThis transformation should always be the last transformation performed on your data. In other\\nwords, after truncations of input data and removal of spatial trends (Figure1).\\nNormal score transformations should be used with caution, particularly if you have limited input\\ndata, as they will force the distribution of your property to exactly match the distribution of your\\ninput, i.e. both the position and the relative height of the histogram bars. If the input data is\\nlimited, then the histogram can be unrepresentative and will be matched exactly by the\\ndistribution of the property modeling result.\\nThis can be avoided by using a Shift scale, Cox-Box or Logarithmic transformations, or by defining\\nthe histogram curve manually.\\nFigure 1.- Normal score transformation settings window.\\nSettings for Normal score transformation\\nThere are two main options for Normal Score transformation:\\nUse values - This will base the transformation purely on your own data. Use it when you\\nhave a large number of data points with a reasonable spread (i.e. a smooth histogram)\\nDefine curve - This option will allow you to edit the curve for the transformation, i.e. allow\\nyou to make a model by using a different distribution from that in your input data. Use it\\nwhen the input data is sparse and the histogram is uneven.\\nIf many of the data points have the same value, spikes will occur in the histogram. Checking the\\nDespike option will ensure that you get a normal distribution even with many equal values.\\nThe Min and Max settings control how far the normal distribution should extend beyond the input\\ndata.

General settings in the Trend modeling process dialog\\nFacies tab (Trend modeling)\\nThe Facies tab lists the facies to be included in the model (Figure 3). By default, this will include\\nall the facies present in the upscaled cells at their fractions relative to the total number of\\nupscaled cells (that is, if half the upscaled cells are sand, the sand fraction will be 50%).\\nChoose the facies codes to be included in the trend model from the facies codes in the template.\\nThe order of the facies is not important for the trend result. The list on the left includes all the\\nfacies codes in the template used and the list on the right includes the facies in the trend model\\nprocess. Add facies to the list on the right using the button and they can be removed from the\\nmodel sequence using the button, they will then reappear in the list on the left hand side.\\nIn the facies template, rows/facies can be added and removed using the Append item in the\\ntable and Delete the last item in the table icons from the Settings window \\\\ Colors tab\\nfor that specific template. The new rows that are added will refer to the discrete logs defined in\\nthe template for the used property.\\nOther tools available are:\\nCopy selected facies settings - Will copy all settings defined for this specific facies.\\nPaste facies - Only available after selecting the copy option. Will apply the settings of the\\ncopied facies to another facies. Click on the tab of another facies and then click on this option.\\nReset settings of the selected facies to defaults - Will reset all the different settings of a\\nfacies to default values.\\nThe Facies tab has two sub-tabs, Variogram and Kriging mean . Variograms, fractions, and\\ntrends can be set for each facies individually.\\nThere is a check box where you can select to use the Same variogram for all facies . This will\\nmake the algorithm run faster. This option is off by default for properties which have not been\\nmodeled before. If the check box is selected and you change the variogram, the variogram will\\nchange for all of the facies (that is, it will not change when you change the facies selection).\\nFigure 3.

It can be either Global or Local mean .\\nReset to default settings - Will set the facies code percentages to undefined.\\nGlobal kriging mean - The global kriging mean can be selected here and is defined using\\nthe percentages for each facies either from the Upscaled cells , Well data or Manual by\\ntyping in a global mean value. The default value is the percent of those facies in the\\nupscaled well logs.\\nThe Global kriging mean can be also taken from Surface/property trend ,\\nspecified as a 2D/3D trend that defines the global mean and will be applied to the cells to be\\nmodeled. This option means that the mean of the 2D surface or 3D property used\\nimplicity gives the global mean . The surface or property can be included into the process\\nby checking on the Local kriging mean option and to drop the surface/property into the\\nbox using the blue button (see Figure 4 below). This option can not be used while clicking\\nthe button Use the Attribute probability curves made in the data analysis .\\nLocal kriging mean given by a surface/property - The kriging mean of the selected\\nfacies code can be made to vary locally using either a 2D surface or 3D property . Values in\\nthe data should range between 0 to 1. This option can be used in the followed cases:\\n1. When using an Ordinary kriging algorithm (to be selected in the Expert tab).

Deutsch, Andre\\nG. Journel or on the GSLIB website www.gslib.com (Support/Training section).\\nHint tab (Trend modeling)\\nThis tab contains general information regarding the Trend modeling process.\\nUser-defined Object Creation\\nUser defined object modeling allows the user to model objects that are not limited in shape to a\\npredetermined set of choices (such as “box”, “ellipsoid”, “cylinder”, etc.), but can have an\\narbitrary geometry defined by the user in three dimensions (channels, bars, splays, reefs,\\nconcretions, etc.). This capability is meant for creating training images for use in multi-point\\ngeostatistical modeling. Creating an object is the first step in user-defined object modeling. The\\nsecond step is using the object to populate a training image in a Facies Modeling run (see User-\\ndefined Objects in Object Modeling).\\nThe User-defined object creation process allows you to create new objects or edit existing\\nones. The purpose of this step is to define the shape of the object. Neither the final dimensions\\nnor the facies are defined at this stage. If the object is to have multiple facies, the shape of the\\nvolume occupied by each facies must defined and identified by an index. Each index is mapped\\ninto a facies later, in the Facies modeling process.\\nUser-defined objects can be of two types:\\nBoundary defined\\nwhich are determined by a set of 3 orthogonal 2D outlines and consist of a single facies\\nCell defined\\nwhich are determined by a three-dimensional set of cells, and may contain multiple facies.\\nSettings for User-defined Object Creation\\nTo start this process, select User-defined object creation under Property modeling in the\\nProcesses pane. This opens a dialog where you can create or edit a user-defined object:\\nThe upper part of the dialog contains the following controls:\\nCreate new – Edit existing\\nSpecifies whether to create a new object or edit an existing one. If no object exists, only the\\nfirst option is available. When creating a new object, its name may be specified. When editing\\nan existing object, it can be selected from the drop-down list.\\nBoundary def object (or Cell-defined object)\\nIndicates whether the object is a Boundary-defined or a Cell-defined object.\\nConvert to Cell or (Convert to Boundary if the object is already a cell-defined object)\\nWhile creating a Boundary defined type object, a Convert to Cell button is displayed which\\nconverts the object to a cell-defined object type. While creating a Cell defined type object, a\\nConvert to Boundary button is displayed which converts the object to a boundary-defined\\nobject type. Conversion almost always causes some loss of shape information. In particular,\\nconversion from a complex cell-defined object to a boundary-defined object may result in a\\nsignificant loss of the original shape, because cell-defined objects generally can reproduce\\nshapes better than boundary-defined objects. The default objects (a simple box, shown\\ninitially or when clicking the Reset button) can be converted back and forth without any loss\\nof information. In general, you should convert the object to the desired type early in the edit\\nprocess. However, sometimes it is desirable to start with a boundary-defined object (which is\\nfaster to edit), and then convert to a cell-defined object to add complexity and perhaps\\nmultiple facies indexes.'},\n",

The main advantage of boundary-defined objects is that\\nthey can be created and edited quickly. Many geometric shapes (cylinders, ellipsoids, boxes,\\noxbow lakes, simple channel sections, and many user-defined variations of those shapes) can be\\nappropriately represented with boundary-defined objects.\\nA boundary-defined object is defined by outlines as seen in three perpendicular two-dimensional\\nviews:\\nA horizontal plan projection of the object.\\nA vertical longitudinal projection of the object.\\nA vertical transversal cross section through the object.\\nEach 2D view consists of two outlines (a “top” and a “bottom” outline for vertical views, and a\\n“left” and a “right” outline for the plan view, shown in red and green in the figure above). Each\\noutline is defined by a set of amplitude values given at regularly spaced points (or \"nodes\") along\\nthe main axis of each 2D view. Each outline is a function along the main axis of the view. Thus,\\neach outline cannot intersect itself and cannot “bend over” itself because each point along the\\nmain axis can have only one amplitude. Additionally, each of the two outlines (top or left) cannot\\ncross the other in the same section (bottom or right), but curves can cross the main axis (that is,\\nhave positive and negative amplitude values).\\nWhen editing a boundary-defined object, the dialog shows one of the three 2D views and allows\\nthe user to edit each side of the outline independently. For example, a portion of a channel, can\\nbe represented by the following three sections (from left to right: plan, longitudinal, and\\ntransversal):\\nNote that the scales of each section need not match (that is, the channel in the cross section\\nappears to be much larger than the channel in plan- or longitudinal view). The sections are\\nautomatically rescaled and matched at the time of modeling.\\nIn boundary-defined objects, the resolution specifies the number of points (or nodes) used for\\neach outline in the current section. The plan and longitudinal views use the same number of\\npoints (along the J- or longitudinal axis of the body). The transversal view uses a set of points\\nalong the I axis of the body. Notice that there is no resolution to be specified along the K axis\\nbecause none of the outlines lies along that axis. The resolution pertains only to the number of\\npoints used in an outline. The position of the outline points across the axis is arbitrary, and can be\\nconsidered to have infinite resolution for practical purposes.\\nThe controls specific to boundary-defined objects are:\\nRight - Left (or Top - Bottom) . Specifies which of the two half outlines to draw. To draw or edit\\nthe outline, the user simply clicks on the graph. The graph automatically prevents crossing of the\\ntwo outlines.\\nDetailed description of boundary-defined object geometry\\nFor a better understanding on how the three 2D views define a unique 3D object, it is necessary\\nto point out that the plan- and longitudinal views are projections of the object on a vertical and a\\nhorizontal plane, respectively, whereas the transversal view is a cross section (not a projection)\\nthat is scaled vertically and horizontally according to the object’s horizontal and vertical\\ndimensions specified by each of the two other projections.\\nTo conceptually reconstruct the object from the three views, consider the horizontal (plan) and\\nvertical (longitudinal) planes, and imagine infinitely many vertical (transversal) planes\\nperpendicular to the first two (all parallel to each other). At each transversal plane, the object has\\na width, height, and position determined by the longitudinal and plan projections. You can place\\nthe transversal section outline in each transversal plane and scale it (independently in the\\nhorizontal and vertical directions) so that the width and height of the body in the section exactly\\nmatch the width and height determined by the plan and longitudinal projections. Then, the set of\\nall scaled transversal sections will uniquely determine a three-dimensional body.\\nThus, it is important to note the following:\\nThe three views are independent from one another. Namely, you do not have to be\\nconcerned with matching any dimension of the body in the different sections. For example,\\nthe width as seen in plan (which varies along the length of the body) need not match the\\nwidth as seen in the transversal section (which will be scaled automatically). .\\nThe three views jointly determine one unique three-dimensional shape, but the converse is\\nnot true; not every 3D shape can be specified in this manner.\\nThe three views are not changeable: if you interchange the transversal section and the\\nlongitudinal section, you do not obtain the same body transposed. You may obtain a\\ndifferent geometry, because one of the views is a projection and the other is a scalable\\nsection. However, the plan and longitudinal views are changeable, in that if you interchange\\nthem, they define the same three dimensional geometry transposed (that is a mirror image\\nrotated 90 degrees).\\nCell-defined objects\\nCell-defined objects should be used when requiring arbitrary shapes that cannot be represented\\nby boundary-defined objects. Objects that might require a cell-defined representation include:\\nchannel pieces with sharply turning meanders, braided channels, objects with holes or cavities, or\\nother arbitrary or very complex shapes. They should also be used when the object requires more\\nthan one facies (however, keep in mind that through proper use of attachment rules, it is often\\npossible and even preferable to use several single-facies objects rather than one multifacies\\nobject). The main advantage of cell-defined objects is that their geometry can be completely\\narbitrary; they can even consist of multiple detached pieces.\\nIt is important to notice that there is no direct correspondence between cells in the object and\\ncells in the final model. The size (in number of cells) when defining the object can be smaller, the\\nsame, or larger than the size (in number of cells) that the object will occupy in the model. Of\\ncourse, if an object with very few cells (for example 3 x 3 x 2) is enlarged to occupy a large\\nnumber of cells in the model, it may have a box-like appearance. The object in the model will\\nhave a number of cells that will depend upon the size of the object as specified in the Geometry\\ntab of the Facies Modeling Process.\\nTo create a cell-defined object, you must first convert a boundary-defined object to a cell-defined\\nobject. The initial boundary-defined object may be the default object (a simple box), or it may\\nalready have been given an initial approximate shape (for example an ellipsoid) and then have\\nbeen converted to add detail and perhaps multiple facies.\\nTo edit a cell defined object, you must edit every cell in three dimensions. It is not sufficient to\\njust edit three perpendicular cross sections (as it is with boundary-defined objects). The dialog\\nallows you to navigate back and forth along the many parallel two dimensional views of the\\nobject.\\nAs an example, if you want to specify a simple cell-defined object (perhaps representing a very\\nshort portion of a channel), you would have to imagine the body embedded in a regular grid, and\\nthen edit that grid to represent the desired body. The process involves setting the desired\\nresolution (number of cells), and then navigating through the sections (using the K-layer control)\\nto set cells to the desired value (either \"erase\" which sets an undefined or background value, or\\n\"draw\" which sets a facies index) by clicking on them. For example, if you would like to draw a\\nchannel, select a plan view on a layer near the top of the grid, and draw a channel shaped body.\\nThen select the transversal view, and navigate through all the J-sections to draw every vertical\\ncross section, using as a reference the single row of cells near the top of the grid that was drawn\\nin the plan view. Now you can verify the shape of the object by selecting another view.\\nThis process is fast for small objects but may be tedious if the object contains a large number of\\ncells. It is also possible to use Petrel’s interactive facies modeling capability to draw an arbitrary\\nobject on any facies property and then copy the object into this dialog. Similarly, a cell-defined\\nobject can be copied into a property, then edited interactively and copied back.\\nThe resolution (number of cells) of the grid can be specified in the dialog (only the two dimensions\\nvisible in each 2D view can be changed, namely I and J for the plan view, J and K for the\\nlongitudinal view, and I and K for the transversal view). Notice that the “grid” is not a Petrel grid.\\nIt is a much simpler, non-dimensional, regular grid, in which all cells appear to be cubes (or\\nsquares in the 2D views). For cell-defined objects all three of the views are true cross sections\\n(not projections). So in addition to specifying which view is displayed (plan, longitudinal, or\\ntransversal) it is also necessary to specify which layer of cells is currently displayed using the\\nlayer control (labelled I-layer, J-layer, or K-layer).\\nThe figure below shows the dialog for editing a cell-defined object, in this case an irregular\\nellipsoid, with a \"core\" consisting of a different facies:\\nThe controls specific to cell-defined objects are:\\nK-layer or I-Section or J-Section\\nselection of layer or section to display, depending on view displayed.'},\n",

Each index\\nwill be replaced by a different facies when the object is used in modeling. It is not convenient (and\\nusually unrealistic) to use more than about three or four facies indexes for a single object. While\\ngeological models can certainly contain more known facies, single objects (which have an\\nimmutable geometry of each facies except for scaling) are not very useful if they are very\\ncomplex. If you need more than three or four facies, it is likely that the objects can be\\ndecomposed into more than one object and rejoined with attachment rules. This ensures that the\\ngeometry will not be immutable, but will vary statistically according to the shape distributions\\nused for each body and their attachment rules.\\nTraining image and pattern creation\\nThe basic input for the Multi-point facies simulation algorithm is the Training image (TI )\\nand the Multi-point facies pattern . There are various methods you can use to make training\\nimages, such as object modeling or hand drawn models. The creation and the use of training\\nimages have been combined with the pattern creation into a process called Training image and\\npattern creation .\\nThe Make pattern process analyzes the Training image and produces a tree or pattern that\\nexplains the neighborhood relationship of the facies (event). Internally, for every event, a pdf (p\\nrior d istribution f unction) is recorded in the pattern.\\nThe result of the training image will be stored in a separate 3D grid (TI grid ) on the Models\\npane, and the result for the pattern process will be stored in a separate folder (Multi-point facies\\npattern folder) on the Input pane and will be used later by the Multi-point facies simulation in\\nthe Facies modeling process.\\nFor detailed information on the Multi-point facies simulation see Multi-point facies simulation\\n.\\nTraining image and pattern creation Settings\\nThe Training image and pattern creation process is found under Property modeling on the\\nProcesses pane. This process has two main tabs: the Make training image grid (Figure 1) and\\nMake pattern (Figure 5).\\nMake training image grid tab\\nThe first part of the process is to create a Training image (TI) . A training image is a facies\\nobject model with a minimum of two facies. For example, an existing object model that can be\\nedited by interactive facies modeling (hand made by using tools as the paintbrush).\\nThe main purpose of the training image is to show the relative position the facies have to each\\nother, with the goal to describe the facies relationship and not the geology (subsurface) in great\\ndetail. As is similar in Neural Networks, there is a risk of overtraining. For simple geological\\nsituations, it is sufficient to know the number of facies and their characteristics.\\nThe training image used in Multi-point statistics is similar to the variogram in Two-point statistics.\\nConsequently, the modeler must design the training image with care, in much the same way as\\nwhen we set up a search cone to explore a variogram.\\nGuidelines for preparing the Training image grid\\n1 . In the Make training image grid tab, you can choose either Create new or Edit existing\\nwhen designing the training image. In the latter case, the settings that were used when the\\nprocess was last run are shown in the dialog. If you want to create a new image from an existing\\none without overwriting the original, make a copy before you run the process.\\n2 . In theory, a training image can be any facies model. For practical reasons it is a good idea to\\nhave a separate model for the training images and for the easiest cases, this can be rectangular\\n. Then you can create an empty simple box model without any structure and zonation/layering by\\ndefining the following parameters:\\nNumber of cells (IJK) - Define the amount of cells in the different grid directions (I,J,K).\\nThe size of the training image grid is important. The training image grid does not have to be\\nas big as the grid where the final results will be produced (model grid). Rather, It is\\nrecommended to have a smaller training image grid than the model grid initially and to\\nwork with the scaling options later. The relationship of the facies will be measured in IJK\\nand not in XYZ. Smaller training grids lead to faster computing time. The critical issue is the\\nratio between the training grid and the model grid. There is no tool for calculating this, so\\nthe recommendation is to use a maximum of 30%, which should work efficiently. Tests have\\nshown that in I,J-directions, 50-200 cells, and in K-direction, 20 cells, can be sufficient in\\nmany cases.\\nCell size (XYZ) - Define the size of the cell in the X,Y and Z directions (be aware of the\\nProject unit system).\\nOrigin (XYZ) - The origin of the image grid can be set up as default (0,0,0) or with any\\nvalues you choose to assign. Generally, the training image grid can have any coordinates,\\nbut in some situations where the training image grid is \"far away\" from the real property,\\nparts of the model may disappear when moving one of these grids in a 2D/3D window.\\nTherefore it is recommended that the training image grid and the property model have\\ncoordinates which are close to each other.\\nFigure 1. Make training image grid process dialog.\\n3 . Once the grid cell parameters are defined, click on the Make grid button and\\na new 3D grid will be created.

Then the Facies modeling\\nprocess will pop up with the Object modeling (stochastic) algorithm selected (Figure 3) and\\nthe training image can be generated as an object model. Additionally, the user defined objects\\ncan be modeled here as a fourth option in Object modeling (stochastic) algorithm (Figure 3).See\\nObject Modeling and User-defined Object Modeling for detailed information on those processes.\\nFigure 3. Facies modeling process dialog for the Training image. See in the Facies bodies tab to\\nthe right side, the four objects (icons) option to model.\\nGenerally, the training image should be as simple as possible. You should not create\\npatterns that are too detailed and with too many facies (>8). In most cases, between 3 to 6 main\\nfacies are sufficient.\\nAnother option to create a training image is by editing an existing facies model, using the painting\\ntools under the Facies Modeling function bar (see Interactive Facies Modeling ).\\nFigure 4. Example of training image (3D).\\nWhen preparing a training image, it is not necessary to explain every unknown detail. It is\\nmore important to show the principal characteristics; e.g. a 3 facies system (shale, channel and\\nlevee) and how they interact.\\nStationarity is also an issue in the Multi-point facies simulation modeling. If you expect to have\\nthe same geological situation everywhere in the field and in the model, one training image is\\nenough. If the situation is more complex, with different geological situations in different regions,\\nyou will have to produce as many training images as there are different regions.\\nMake pattern tab\\nIn the Make pattern tab, you can choose between Create new or Edit existing for your\\npattern. In the latter case, the settings that were used when the process was last run are shown\\nin the dialog. If you want to create a new pattern from an existing one without overwriting the\\noriginal, make a copy before you run the process.\\nFigure 5. Make pattern process dialog.\\nTraining image\\nThe Training image is the facies object model generated in the Make training image grid and\\nFacies modeling processes. Select it from the Models pane/Training image grid /Property\\nfolder and using the blue arrow, drop it into the process.\\nSearch mask\\nThe purpose of the Search mask section is to define a search area by using a geometrical\\nshape. It can be Ellipsoid or Rectangular (the last one is bigger).\\nThe Radius in Number of cells in IJK direction is comparable to the search radius in classical\\ngeostatistics and will be applied on the training image. The Effective radius (search radius) is\\nalso shown on the coarsest grid level in IJK domain.'},\n",

When\\nworking with multi-grids, the subgrid concept is automatically working in the background (see\\nnext section).\\nThere are two parameters that should be defined:\\nNumber of multi-grids - defines how many multigrids you want to work with.\\nMax number of informed nodes from current sub-grid - defines how many nodes\\nfrom the current sub-grid are used for simulation of a point. Nearby points are\\nautomatically used. Many points will generally give better results, but also tend to slow\\ndown the computation time. If you are not satisfied with the results, increasing the number\\nof cells used in the search mask (> 100 or up to ~10%) will help to improve them.\\nThe Multi-grid and Sub-grid concept\\nWorking with multi-grids and sub-grids makes the algorithm more efficient. The main goal of\\nmulti-grids is to describe both small and large scale structures as short and long variogram\\nranges in the 2 point geostatistics.\\nWhen creating a multi-point facies pattern the coarsest grid will be populated first and the finest\\ngrid last. In the coarsest grid every 2^(m-1) (m=number of multi-grids) cell will be addressed\\n(dark green cells in Multi-grid 4 in Figure 6). In the second coarsest grid, these cells work as\\nalready defined nodes like cells in a Gaussian simulation (now blue in Multi-grid 3). Using sub-\\ngrids means the cells sitting perfectly in the middle of the already defined cells will be populated\\nfirst (dark green), followed by the others in between (light green). This goes on until all cells are\\naddressed (Multi-grid 1 example in figure 6 below). The sub-grid concept is automatically\\nimplemented and works in the background.\\nWhen working (for example) with 4 multi-grids on the the coarsest grid level every 2^(4-1) = 8th\\ncell will be populated first (multi-grid 4). In multi-grid 3 every 2^(3-1) = 4th cell is simulated, but\\nthe centrally placed cells first and then followed by all others. In multi-grid 2, every second cell is\\nsimulated until finally every cell is done in the last step (multi-grid 1).'},\n",

The first image (multi-\\ngrid 1) shows a complete picture, but it needs a big search radius in the mask and therefore a\\nlarge pattern (tree and file). Multi-grid 2 is still a good representation of the facies association but\\nit needs a big search radius. In multi-grid 3 the facies are still visible and the search mask would\\nnot be too big. In Multi-grid 4 the ability to recognize stacked channels is lost. It would run very\\nfast but would give poor result.\\nFigure 7. Training image shown in multi-grids.\\nRelationship between Training image, Search mask and Multi-grid\\nIt is necessary to understand the relationship between all the settings. For example, when you set\\nup a 10x10x3 cell search in the Search mask and are working with 3 multi-grids , the search\\ncovers on the coarsest level:\\n2^(3-1) * 10 * 2 = 80 cells (horizontal)\\n2^(3-1) * 3 * 2 = 24 layers (vertical)\\nAt present, the Search mask cannot determine the optimal settings in the Search mask section\\nlike there is for the variogram modeling (range, sill, nugget, etc.). However, if you make the\\nassumption from the classical 2 point geostatistics that the search radius for variogram modeling\\nshould not be bigger than approximately 2/3 of the whole model extension, one conclusion can be\\nthat the training image should not be bigger than 120x120x36 cells. Or vice versa, if the training\\nimage has the dimension 200x200x30 cells and a Search mask using 3 multi-grids, then a\\nsufficient radius would be 17x17x3 cells. Working with bigger search radius will improve the image\\nslightly but will produce very large files.\\nThe result of Make multi-point facies pattern\\nWhen you are finished with the settings and press Apply, a pattern will be established. According\\nto the settings for any possible geometrical setup in every multi-grid, a pdf (prior density\\nfunction) will be calculated.

    "The script outlined below serves a crucial role in processing a list of text strings, specifically ensuring that none of the strings breach a predetermined character limit range, set here between 6,000 and 8,000 characters. This boundary is crucial when working with certain text processing APIs or systems that impose restrictions on the amount of text they can handle within a single operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed breakdown of the script's operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Utility Function (`split_text_into_sentences`)**: Initially, the script employs a utility function that fragments the text into individual sentences using regular expressions to identify sentence terminators (like periods or question marks) while avoiding common false positives (such as abbreviations).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Processing Function (`process_strings`)**: The main logic resides in the `process_strings` function, which iterates through each string in the provided list. This function segments the text into sentences and dynamically aggregates them, ensuring each combined string respects the defined minimum and maximum character constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Buffer Management for Text Aggregation**: A 'buffer' string temporarily holds the aggregated sentences. When the addition of a new sentence causes the buffer to approach the maximum limit, the function evaluates the buffer's length:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the buffer exceeds the minimum character threshold, it is appended to the final list of processed strings, emptied, and then initiated with the new sentence.\n",
    "   - If the buffer falls short of the minimum characters, the function continues to add sentences until it surpasses the minimum length, even if this means momentarily exceeding the maximum character limit. This ensures no processed string is below the acceptable length, accommodating scenarios where an original text string is too short.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Post-Processing and Edge Case Handling**: After iteratively processing each text string from the original list, the script addresses any residual content in the buffer. If this content surpasses the minimum character limit, it is added to the final list, ensuring valuable information isn't discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Preparation**: The script concludes by returning a new list (`rearranged_strings`), consisting of the restructured text strings. Each entry in this list complies with the character restrictions, making them suitable for systems or APIs sensitive to text length.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures the integrity of the processed text, respecting logical content boundaries (like sentences) and maintaining the meaningful sequence of information, thereby readying the data for further text processing tasks within character-bound constraints.\n"
